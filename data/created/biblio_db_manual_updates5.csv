281,SCOPUS,ARTICLE,1968,WOODS CS,"GROWTH CHARACTERISTICS, PIGMENTATION, AND THE IDENTIFICATON OF WHITEBAIT (GALAXIAS SPP., SALMONOIDEA)",NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,NA,"DEFINITIONS ARE GIVEN FOR STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF FIVE SPECIES OF GALAXIAS, FAMILY GALAXIIDAE, WHICH HAVE MARINE LARVAE. LARVAE OF GALAXIAS MACULATES ATTENUATES AND G. BREVIPINNIS ARE LARGE, AND THOSE OF G. FASCIATUS RELATIVELY SMALL AS THEY ENTER FRESH WATER FROM THE SEA. DEVELOPMENT AS WHITEBAIT INVOLVES SHRINKAGE BY ABOUT 25% IN TOTAL LENGTH; THE HEAD LENGTH, CONSIDERED SEPARATELY, SHRINKS BY ABOUT 15%. THE RATIO OF STANDARD LENGTH TO HEAD LENGTH ALTERS FROM THE LARVAL TO THE ADULT VALUE BEFORE POSITIVE GROWTH RECOMMENCES. THESE FEATURES ARE PROBABLY SIMILAR FOR G. POSTVECTIS AND G. ARGENTEUS MINIMUM OBSERVED PIGMENTATION IS DESCRIBED FOR THE LATE LARVAE OF G M. ATTENUATES, G. BREVIPINNIS, AND G. FASCIATUS AND FOR EARLY WHITEBAIT OF THESE AND OF G. POSTVECTIS AND G. ARGENTEUS SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT OF MELANOPHORES AND OF COLOUR PATTERN IS DESCRIBED AND FIGURED. LARGE MELANOPHORES ALONG THE LATERAL LINE DISTINGUISH EARLY WHITEBAIT OF G. M. ATTENUATES, BUT NO DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF PIGMENTATION HAS BEEN FOUND IN OTHER SPECIES UNTIL THE JUVENILE PATTERN IS APPARENT. THIS PATTERN IS CHARACTERISTIC FOR EACH SPECIES, AND IT PERSISTS IN ADULT G. M. ATTENUATES. G. ARGENTEUS HAS DISTINCT JUVENILE AND ADULT PATTERNS, THE LATTER BEING DEVELOPED IN A SECOND, SUPERFICIAL, LAYER OF PIGMENT CELLS. ADULT G. POSTVECTIS DEVELOP A DISTINCTIVE FIN COLOUR PATTERN UNLIKE OTHER NEW ZEALAND GALAXIAS; THE SUPERFICIAL PIGMENT LAYER IS WITHOUT DEFINITE PATTERN. IN ADULT G. BREVIPINNIS THIS LAYER RESEMBLES THE PERSISTENT JUVENILE PATTERN AND THE TWO LAYERS COMBINED GIVE A RETICULATE APPEARANCE. IN G. FASCIATUS THE JUVENILE PATTERN PERSISTS AND DEVELOPS AS THE FISH GROW; THE SUPERFICIAL PIGMENT LAYER IS PRESENT IN ADULTS BUT IS NOT USUALLY APPARENT. UNTIL NOW POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF WHITEBAIT HAS DEPENDED ON COLOUR PATTERN. RECENTLY RECORDED IDENTIFICATIONS OF UNPIGMENTED WHITEBAIT ARE SHOWN TO BE MISLEADING. A KEY IS GIVEN FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF EARLY AND LATE WHITEBAIT USING ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENTS AS AN IMPORTANT CHARACTER.

LIFE CYCLE AND ORIGIN,MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,NA,"IN CONTRAST TO MOST OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY GALAXIIDAE WHICH LIVE AND REPRODUCE IN FRESH WATER, GALAXIAS MACULATUS, THE COMMON JOLLYTAIL OF AUSTRALIA AND WHITEBAIT OF NEW ZEALAND, IS NORMAILY CATADROMOUS THROUGHOUT ITS RANGE (SOUTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, AND SOUTHERN SOUTH AMERICA). IN SOME ATHALASSIC INLAND LAKES ON THE VOLCANIC PLAINS OF SOUTH-WESTERN VICTORIA, HOWEVER, A NUMBER OF POPULATIONS APPARENTLY DESCENDED FROM THIS SPECIES HAVE BECOMELANDLOCKED. THE LIFE CYCLE OF THE FORMINHABITING ONE OF THESE LAKES (THE LANDLOCKED JOLLYTAIL OF LAKE MODEWARRE) MAY BE BRIEFLY SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: GONADAL MATURATION IN THE ADULT FISH, WHICH LIVE IN THE SLIGHTLY SALINE LANDLOCKED LAKE, BEGINS AROUND MARCH AND IS ALMOST COMPLETED BY ABOUT JUNE. THE FINAL STAGE OF MATURATION IS NOT REACHED, HOWEVER, UNTIL THESE FISH MIGRATE SHORT DISTANCES UP INTERMITTENT INFLOWING CREEKS WHEN THE LATTER BEGIN TO FLOW IN LATE WINTER AND SPRING (JULY-OCTOBER). SPAWNING TAKES PLACE WHEN THE CREEKS ARE SWOLLEN AFTER HEAVY RAIN, THE EGGS BEING DEPOSITED AMONGST FLOODED VEGETATION IN SHALLOW AREAS OF SLOW-FLOWING WATER ALONG THE CREEK BANKS. MANY OF THE SPENT FISH DIE AFTER SPAWNING. THE EGGS, WHICH ARE STRANDED WHEN THE FLOOD-WATERS SUBSIDE, DEVELOP AMONGST THE VEGETATION ON THE BANKS ABOVE THE NORMAL WATER LEVEL. AFTER DEVELOPMENT IS COMPLETE REIMMERSION BY THE FIRST FLOOD TO COVER THEM STIMULATES HATCHING. THE NORMAL DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD IS PROBABLY ABOUT 2 WEEKS, BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF FLOODING HATCHING CAN BE DELAYED UP TO AT LEAST A MONTH AFTER FERTILIZATION. THE NEWLY HATCHED LARVAE ARE WASHED DOWNSTREAM INTO THE LAKE WHERE THEY FEED AND GROW TO MATURITY. THEY MIGRATE UPSTREAM TO SPAWN IN THE FOLLOWING LATE WINTER-EARLY SPRING SEASON AT AN AGE OF APPROXIMATELY 1 YEAR. THE FISH GROW TO ABOUT 9 CM IN THEIR FIRST YEAR, 14 CM IN THEIR SECOND, AND 17 CM IN THEIR THIRD YEAR. THE AVERAGE SIZE OF THE FEMALES IS GREATER THAN THAT OF THE MALES. THE GENERAL FEATURES OF THE LIFE HISTORY OF THIS LANDLOCKED FORM ARE COMPARED AND CONTRASTED WITH THOSE OF THE STREAM-DWELLING SPECIES G. MACULATUS AND A NUMBER OF OTHER SALMONIFORM FISHES. THE GEOLOGICAL ORIGIN OF THE COMPLEX OF LAKES IN SOUTH-WESTERN VICTORIA INHABITED BY LANDLOCKED GALAXIID POPULATIONS IS DISCUSSED, AND AN HYPOTHESIS CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF THE LAKE MODEWARRE FORM FROM AN ANCESTRAL POPULATION OF G.

STRUCTURE OF GONADS,AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,NA,"CHANGES IN THE GROSS MORPHOLOGY AND HISTOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF THE GONADS OF A LANDLOCKED FORM OF GALAXIAS MACULATUS INHABITING LAKE MODEWARRE, SOUTH-WESTERN VICTORIA, ARE DESCRIBED IN RELATION TO THE SEASONAL PATTERN OF GONADAL MATURATION OUTLINED IN A PREVIOUS PAPER ON THE LIFE HISTORY OF THIS FISH. MACROSCOPIC CHANGES IN THE GROSS MORPHOLOGY OF THE GONADS ARE CLASSIFIED AS TO SEVEN ARBITRARY MATURITY STAGES, THESE APPROXIMATELY CORRESPONDING, IN THE CASE OF THE MALE, WITH SEVEN HISTOLOGICAL STAGES OF TESTICULAR DEVELOPMENT. NINE STAGES OF OOCYTE DEVELOPMENT IN THE OVARIES OF FEMALE FISH ARE ALSO OUTLINED, AND A SINGLE CASE OF SYNCHRONOUS ABNORMAL HERMAPHRODITISM IS DESCRIBED. THE ABOVE FINDINGS ARE THEN DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO THOSE OF PREVIOUS STUDIES ON THE GONADS OF A VARIETY OF TELEOST FISHES, AND IN PARTICULAR A NUMBER OF OTHER FORMS ALSO BELONGING TO THE ORDER SALMONIFORMES.","AHSAN SN, 1966, CAN J ZOOLOG, V44, P149, DOI 10.1139/Z66-014; ANDREU BUENAVENTURA, 1951, BOL INST ESPANOL OCEANOGR, V41, P1; ARNDT EA, 1956, PROTOPLASMA, V47, P1, DOI 10.1007/BF01252434; ARNDT EA, 1960, Z ZELLFORSCH MIK ANA, V51, P209, DOI 10.1007/BF00343678; ATZ JW, 1964, INTERSEXUALITY VERTE; BENZIE VL, 1961, THESIS U CANTERBURY; BOWERS AB, 1961, MAR RES, P1; COURRIER R, 1921, CR SOC BIOL, V85, P939; CRAIG-BENNETT A, 1931, PHILOS T R SOC LON B, V219, P197, DOI 10.1098/RSTB.1931.0005; EHRENBAUM E, 1930, RAPP CONS EXPLOR MER, V74, P116; EIGEMANN CH, 1890, MEM MUSEUM COMP ZOOL, V19, P129; HEINCKE F, 1898, ABH DEUTSCH SEEFISCH, V2; HENDERSON NE, 1962, CAN J ZOOLOG, V40, P631, DOI 10.1139/Z62-058; HIKITA T, 1958, 12 HOKK SALM HATCH S, P111; HJORT J, 1910, 53 PUBLS CIRC CONS P, P1; HURLEY DA, 1966, CAN J ZOOLOG, V44, P173, DOI 10.1139/Z66-016; JONES JW, 1940, PROC R SOC SER B-BIO, V128, P499, DOI 10.1098/RSPB.1940.0023; KONOPACKA B., 1937, PUBBLICAZIONI DELLA STAZIONE ZOOLOGICA DI NAPOLI, V16, P327; KONOPACKA B, 1935, B INT ACAD POLONAISE, V3, P163; LOFTS B, 1966, GEN COMP ENDOCR, V6, P74, DOI 10.1016/0016-6480(66)90109-2; LOFTS B, 1957, Q J MICROSC SCI, V98, P79; MARSHALL A.

BIOLOGICAL SPECIES CRITERIA BREAK DOWN BECAUSE OF THE GENERAL OCCURRENCE OF ALLOPATRY, AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE TAXONOMY OF FRESHWATER FISHES ARE EXPLORED. ESSENTIALLY MORPHOLOGICAL CRITERIA MUST BE USED, BUT THEIR USE MUST BE SUBJECT TO CAREFUL SCRUTINY, AND PATTERNS OF VARIATION MUST BE STUDIED. GALAXIAS MACULATUS (JENYNS) IS SHOWN TO OCCUR IN AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, CHATHAM ISLANDS, CHILE, TIERRA DEL FUEGO, AND FALKLAND ISLANDS IN THE TYPICAL DIADROMOUS FORM. SUBSPECIES ARE NOT RECOGNISED. LANDLOCKED OR FRESHWATER-LIMITED POPULATIONS OCCUR THROUGH MUCH OF THE RANGE OF THE SPECIES, AND IN THESE POPULATIONS VERTEBRAL NUMBER IS REDUCED TO ABOUT 55, FROM ABOUT 62 IN DIADROMOUS STOCKS. THESE POPULATIONS ARE NOT GIVEN SEPARATE TAXONOMIC RECOGNITION, VARIATION IN VERTEBRAL NUMBER BEING REGARDED AS RELATED TO THE TRANSITION FROM A DIADROMOUS TO A WHOLLY FRESHWATER LIFE HISTORY; G. USITATUS MCDOWALL AND G. PARRISHI STOKELL BECOME SYNONYMS OF G. MACULATUS. FURTHER POPULATIONS IN SMALL LAKES IN NORTH AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND, HAVE ONLY ABOUT 49 VERTEBRAE.

COMPOSITION OF THE DIET,MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,NA,"THE COMPOSITION OF THE DIET OF A LANDLOCKED FORM OF THE NORMALLY CATADROMOUS STREAM-DWELLING FISH GALAXIAS MACULATUS FROM LAKE MODEWARRE IN SOUTH-WESTERN VICTORIA WAS STUDIED USING A NEW METHOD OF STOMACH CONTENTS ANALYSIS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF RANKING. THE OVERALL DIET OF THIS LANDLOCKED FISH WAS FOUND TO CONSIST MAINLY OF AMPHIPODS, CHIRONOMID LARVAE, AND COPEPODS (BASIC FOOD TYPES), WITH OTHER GROUPS OF CRUSTACEANS (CLADOCERANS AND OSTRACODS) AND INSECTS (TRICHOPTERAN AND ZYGOPTERAN LARVAE) BEING OF LESSER IMPORTANCE (SECONDARY FOOD TYPES), AND A FEW OTHER INCIDENTAL FOOD TYPES OCCURRING IN ONLY SMALL AMOUNTS. THE DIET OF THIS LANDLOCKED FORM THUS CONSISTS MAINLY OF CRUSTACEANS, IN CONTRAST TO THAT OF THE STREAM-DWELLING FORM WHICH COMPRISES MAINLY INSECTS. THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE PATTERN OF FEEDING IN THE LANDLOCKED FISH WITH GROWTH, THE SMALLER FISH EATING MORE OF THE SMALLER PLANKTONIC AND THE LARGER FISH MORE OF THE LARGER LITTORAL-BENTHIC FOOD ORGANISMS. AMPHIPODS WERE THE DOMINANT FOOD TYPE DURING ALL SEASONS EXCEPT AUTUMN, WHEN COPEPODS WERE DOMINANT. CLADOCERANS WERE ALSO IMPORTANT WHEN THEY BLOOMED IN SUMMER, AND CHIRONOMID ADULTS WHEN THEY SWARMED IN AUTUMN. SELECTION COEFFICIENTS INDICATED THAT THOSE FOOD TYPES WHICH WERE DOMINANT IN THE DIET WERE ACTIVELY SELECTED AND THOSE THAT WERE UNIMPORTANT WERE AVOIDED. THIS LANDLOCKED GALAXIID WAS FOUND TO SHARE MOST OF THE AVAILABLE FOOD RESOURCES WITH THE OTHER FOUR FISH SPECIES FOUND IN THE LAKE, AND CAN BE BROADLY CLASSIFIED AS A EURYPHAGIC CARNIVORE. 1973 CSIRO.

EFFECTS OF CESTODE AND NEMATODE PARASITES,MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,NA,"TWO HELMINTH PARASITES, A CESTODE AND A NEMATODE, WERE FOUND TO INFECT THE LANDLOCKED FORM OF GALAXIAS MACULATUS INHABITING LAKE MODEWARRE, A SLIGHTLY SALINE LAKE IN SOUTH-WESTERN VICTORIA. THE CESTODE, FROM THE HOSTS COELOMIC CAVITY, WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE PLEROCERCOID STAGE OF THE PSEUDO-PHYLLIDEAN GENUS LIGULA, THE OCCURRENCE OF WHICH IN THE AUSTRALASIAN REGION CONSTITUTES A NEW ZOO-GEOGRAPHIC REGIONAL RECORD, AND IN G. MACULATUS A NEW HOST-FAMILY RECORD. THE MEAN PERCENTAGE WEIGHT OF PLEROCERCOIDS PER INFECTED FISH WAS APPROXIMATELY 9%, AND THE MAXIMUM ALMOST 50% OF THE INTACT HOST WEIGHT. THE MEAN NUMBER OF PLEROCERCOIDS PER FISH WAS APPROXIMATELY 0-75, OR 1-5 PER INFECTED FISH, AND THE MAXIMUM NUMBER PER FISH WAS FIVE. THE MEAN INCIDENCE OF INFECTION WAS APPROXIMATELY 50%. THE EFFECTS OF THESE CESTODES ON THE HOST FISH INCLUDED A REDUCTION IN GENERAL BODY CONDITION, AN INHIBITION OF GONADAL MATURATION, AND AN INHIBITION, DURING THE REPRODUCTIVE SEASON, OF MOVEMENTS TO THE SPAWNING AREAS. THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS CESTODE MAY HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED BY MAN TOGETHER WITH EXOTIC FISHES FROM THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE IS DISCUSSED. THE NEMATODE, USUALLY FOUND ENCYSTED IN THE VISCERAL PERITONEUM, WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE LARVAL FORM OF EUSTRONGYLIDES SP. (PROBABLY GADOPSIS), FAMILY DIOCTOPHYMIDAE. THE MEAN NUMBER OF NEMATODES PER FISH WAS 4-4, OR 5 4 FOR INFECTED FISH, AND THE MAXIMUM NUMBER PER FISH WAS 44. THE MEAN INCIDENCE OF INFECTION WAS APPROXIMATELY 80%. ONE OF THE EFFECTS OF THIS NEMATODE ON ITS HOST WAS THE INHIBITION OF EGG LAYING BY FEMALE FISH WHEN ENCYSTED IN THE OVARY OR VENT. THIS SPECIES WAS ALSO FOUND IN AN ELEOTRINE GOBY AND IN RAINBOW TROUT, AND A SIMILAR FORM (PROBABLY AN INTERMEDIATE-ADULT STAGE OF THE SAME SPECIES) IN THE CORMORANT PHALACROCORAX VARIUS, FROM THE SAME LAKE. 1974 ASEG.","ANNIGERI, G.G., A VIVIPAROUS NEMATODE, PHILOMETRA SP.

268,SCOPUS,ARTICLE,1980,MCDOWALL RM,FRESHWATER FISHES AND PLATE TECTONICS IN THE SOUTHWEST PACIFIC,"PALAEOGEOGRAPHY, PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY, PALAEOECOLOGY",NA,"IN CONSIDERING FRESHWATER FISHES IN THE SOUTHWEST PACIFIC ATTENTION IS FOCUSSED, FAIRLY OBVIOUSLY, ON THE AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND REGIONS. THE NUMEROUS MORE ISOLATED ISLANDS OF THE AREA, LIKE NEW CALEDONIA, NORFOLK AND LORD HOWE, ARE LARGELY DEVOID OF FRESHWATER FISH SPECIES, ALTHOUGH NEW CALEDONIA HAS A FRESHWATER-LIMITED GALAXIID AND LORD HOWE HAS ONE THAT IS DIADROMOUS (I.E. REGULARLY SPENDS A PART OF ITS LIFE CYCLE IN THE SEA). MOST OF THE ISLANDS OF THE SOUTHWESTERN PACIFIC ALSO HAVE FRESHWATER EELS, BUT THESE, TOO, ARE DIADROMOUS. THE REMAINING FRESHWATER FISHES OF THE NUMEROUS, MOSTLY TROPICAL ISLANDS OF THE WESTERN PACIFIC ARE PROBABLY OF DIRECT MARINE DERIVATION AND ARE OF LITTLE INTEREST IN A DISCUSSION OF FRESHWATER FISH BIOGEOGRAPHY. THUS ANY ANALYSIS OF THE BIOGEOGRAPHY OF FISHES OF THE SOUTHWESTERN PACIFIC IS CONCERNED PRIMARILY WITH THE FAUNAS OF AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND AND THEIR ASSOCIATED ISLANDS. BOTH AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND HAVE SMALL FRESHWATER FISH FAUNAS. AUSTRALIA (INCLUDING TASMANIA) HAS ABOUT 170 SPECIES WITH A FURTHER 180 OR SO IN NEW GUINEA. (HOWEVER, THE FAUNA OF NEW GUINEA IS POORLY KNOWN.) NEW ZEALAND HAS ONLY 27 FRESHWATER SPECIES. THE AUSTRALIAN FAUNA REVEALS A BROAD MIXTURE OF RELATIONSHIPS. SOME ANCIENT FORMS INDICATE PANGEAN OR GONDWANIAN ORIGINS WITH RELATIONSHIPS, WHERE UNDERSTOOD, IN DISTANT AND DISJUNCT AREAS OF THE GLOBE (NEOCERATODUS, SCLEROPAGES, LEPIDOGALAXIAS). SPECIES WITH PAN-TROPICAL RELATIONSHIPS MAY REPRESENT OLD GONDWANIAN DISTRIBUTIONS (OPHISTERNUM), OR ALTERNATIVELY, MORE RECENT MARINE DISPERSALS (ARIID CATFISHES). A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE FAUNA HAS COOL SOUTHERN TEMPERATE RELATIONSHIPS (GEOTRIA, GALAXIAS), MANY HAVE WIDESPREAD INDO-PACIFIC RELATIONSHIPS (GOBIIDAE, ANGUILLIDAE, CLUPEIDAE, ETC.), WHILE A FEW HAVE AS YET INDETERMINATE RELATIONSHIPS (PERCICHTHYIDAE). THE AFFINITIES OF NEW ZEALAND FRESHWATER FISHES ARE DIVIDED BETWEEN WARMER INDO-PACIFIC GROUPS (ELEOTRIDAE, ANGUILLA) AND COOL COUTHERN TEMPERATE GROUPS (GEOTRIA, GALAXIAS), BOTH HAVING CLOSE AUSTRALIAN RELATIONSHIPS, THE COOL-TEMPERATE SPECIES ALSO HAVING SOUTH AMERICAN AFFINITIES. THE OLDER ELEMENTS, WITH BROAD GLOBAL RELATIONSHIPS, DEMONSTRATE PATTERNS THAT MAY BE A PRODUCT OF AN ANCESTRAL SOUTHERN CONTINENT, BUT MANY GROUPS SEEM LIKELY TO HAVE ATTAINED THEIR DISTRIBUTIONS MORE RECENTLY, AND TO BE A PRODUCT OF MARINE DISPERSALS. 1980.","ANDREWS, A REVISION OF THE FAMILY GALAXIIDAE (PISCES) IN TASMANIA (1976) AUST.

THE DIETS OF BLUEGILLED BULLY (GOBIOMORPHUS HUBBSI), UPLAND BULLY (G. BREVICEPS), JUVENILE LONGFINNED EEL (ANGUILLA DIEFFENBACHII), GALAXIAS BREVIPINNIS, G.

FOOD NICHE OVERLAP BETWEEN THESE SPECIES WAS HIGH, INDICATING POTENTIAL COMPETITION, BUT PREFERRED HABITAT AND FEEDING HABIT DIFFERENCES PLUS LOW FISH POPULATION DENSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF MAIN PREY ITEMS PROBABLY ELIMINATE THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY SERIOUS COMPETITION. THE DIET OF THE OTHER FISH SPECIES DIFFERED FROM THIS PATTERN. THE COMMON BULLY (GOBIOMORPHUS COTIDIANUS) ATE PROPORTIONALLY MORE CHIRONOMID LARVAE AND FISH EGGS THAN OCCURRED IN THE BENTHOS; TORRENTFISH (CHEIMARRICHTHYS FOSTERI) ATE PROPORTIONALLY MORE CHIRONOMID LARVAE THAN OCCURRED IN THE BENTHOS; AND QUINNAT SALMON (ONCORHYNCHUS TSHAWYTSCHA) DEPENDED LARGELY UPON PREY SPECIES OF TERRESTIAL ORIGIN, SUCH AS ADULT DELEATIDIUM AND DIPTERANS. 1983 TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP, LLC.","ALLEN, K.R., THE HOROKIWI STREAM.

AFTER TREATMENT WITH 21.3 MG DRY CELLS, THE DEGRADATION EFFICIENCY WAS 97.4% FOR 20 MG L-1 CTN IN THE AQUEOUS PHASE. MEANWHILE, TREATMENT WITH CRUDE ENZYME SOLUTION CONTAINING 2.0 MG ML-1 PROTEIN LED TO COMPLETE DEGRADATION OF 20.0 MG L-1 CTN WITHIN 10 H, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER THAN THAT OF TUAH-1. THE RESULTS ALSO SHOWED THAT CTN COULD NOT BE DETECTED AFTER TREATMENT WITH 5.68 G TUAH-1 PER KG SOIL FOR 48 H WHEN THE ORIGINAL CTN CONTENT IN THE SOIL WAS 10 MG KG-1. AFTER TREATMENT WITH THAH-1 OR ITS CRUDE PROTEINS, MANY DEGRADATION PRODUCTS WERE DETECTED BY HPLC-MS, SUGGESTING TWO POSSIBLE DEGRADATION PATHWAYS. THE MECHANISM OF CTN DEGRADATION BY TUAH-1 WAS NOTED TO BE MULTIENZYMATIC CATALYSIS COMPRISING GLYCERALDEHYDE-3-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE AND GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE.","ALABASTER JS, 1982, WATER QUALITY CRITER; BOYLAND E, 1962, ANNU REV PHARMACOL, V2, P129, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV.PA.02.040162.001021; CHIN BH, 1981, B ENVIRON CONTAM TOX, V26, P258, DOI 10.1007/BF01622087; CHIN BH, 1980, TOXICOL LETT; CHIOU CT, 1981, HAZARD ASSESSMENT CH, V1, P117; DAVIES PE, 1984, J LABELLED COMPD RAD, V21, P285, DOI 10.1002/JLCR.2580210309; DODD DE, 1982, TOXICOL APPL PHARM, V62, P228, DOI 10.1016/0041-008X(82)90121-1; GUTENMANN WH, 1967, J DAIRY SCI, V49, P1272; JAKOBY W B, 1978, ADV ENZYMOL RELAT AREAS MOL BIOL, V46, P383; KLAVERKAMP J.F., 1982, AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY (NEW YORK), V1, P1; KOBAYASHI K., 1979, ACS SYM SER, V99, P131; LONG JW, 1975, CHEM-BIOL INTERACT, V10, P383, DOI 10.1016/0009-2797(75)90069-1; MAJEWSKI HS, 1978, WATER RES, V13, P217; MCDOWALL RM, 1980, FRESHWATER FISHES SE; MOUNT DI, 1967, WATER RES, V1, P21, DOI 10.1016/0043-1354(67)90061-9; NIMMO IA, 1979, COMP BIOCHEM PHYS B, V63, P423, DOI 10.1016/0305-0491(79)90272-4; NIMMO IA, 1981, COMP BIOCHEM PHYS B, V68, P579, DOI 10.1016/0305-0491(81)90078-X; NISHIUCHI Y, 1977, SEIKATSU KANKYO, V22, P28; NISHIUCHI Y, 1979, SUISAN ZOSHOKU, V27, P36; NORSETH T, 1982, ACTA PHARMACOL TOX, V51, P450; PEREVOZNIKOV MA, 1977, IZV GOS MAUCHNO ISST, V121, P95; SHAROM MS, 1981, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V38, P198; SPRAGUE JB, 1971, WATER RES, V5, P45; SZALKOWSKI MB, 1977, J AGR FOOD CHEM, V25, P208, DOI 10.1021/JF60209A014; TILLMAN RW, 1973, PESTIC BIOCHEM PHYS, V3, P160, DOI 10.1016/0048-3575(73)90100-4; TURNER NJ, 1970, CONTRIB BOYCE THOMPS, V24, P203; TURNER NJ, 1969, CONTRIB BOYCE THOMPS, V24, P139; 1979, PESTICIDE MANUAL; 1975, STANDARD METHODS EXA; 1975, WHO TECHN REP SER, V544",10.1016/0166-445X(85)90038-4,55,AUSTRALIA;AUSTRALIA,382,TERTIARY,UNIVERSITY OF TASMANIA,AUSTRALIA,TASMANIA,N,N,N,N,N,Y,REACH,NA,Y,0.01,3,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,NA,TOXOCOLOGY,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N

TRUTTA, GALAXIAS MACULATUS, G. TRUTTACEUS AND G. AURATUS. MOLECULAR WEIGHTS AND HEPATIC ACTIVITY TOWARD 1-CHLORO-2,4-DINITROBENZENE (CDNB) OF GST WERE DETERMINED IN ALL SPECIES. LOW LEVEL EXPOSURE TO TCIN WAS FOUND TO INDUCE HIGHER GST ACTIVITY IN G. MACULATUS, G. TRUTTACEUS AND S. GAIRDNERI. OTHER PROPERTIES OF GST ENZYMES INVESTIGATED IN THESE FISH INCLUDED TCIN BINDING, REACTION ORDER AND THE EFFECT OF ACEPHATE ON ACTIVITY. THE EFFECT OF TCIN EXPOSURE ON LIVER THIOL AND GLUTATHIONE (GSH) LEVELS IN S. GAIRDNERI AND G. TRUTTACEUS WAS INVESTIGATED. SIGNIFICANT DECREASES OCCURRED IN LIVER THIOL LEVELS OF FISH WHEN EXPOSED TO VARYING CONCENTRATIONS OF TCIN FOR 96 H WITHOUT FEEDING. LIVER GSH LEVELS INCREASED IN S. GAIRDNERI EXPOSED TO 10 G/L OVER 96 H WITH FEEDING. A MARKED INCREASE IN GST ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED DURING 96 H EXPOSURE TO 10 G/L. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE ACTIVITY OF GLYCERALDEHYDE 3-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE (GAPDH) WERE OBSERVED DURING EXPOSURE TO 10 G/L TCIN IN VIVO. A TRANSIENT DECREASE IN ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED DURING EXPOSURE TO 30 G/L TCIN. THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN VITRO INHIBITION OF GAPDH BY TCIN WAS STUDIED IN THE CONTEXT OF LIVER CYTOSOLIC LEVELS OF GAPDH AND GSH. HEPATIC GSH AND GST ACTIVITY LEVELS TOWARD 14C-TCIN AND CDNB WERE COMPARED IN S. GAIRDNERI, G. MACULATUS AND G. AURATUS. THE ORDER OF ASYMPTOTIC LC50 VALUES FOR THE THREE SPECIES AGREED WITH THAT FOR TOTAL HEPATIC GST ACTIVITY TOWARD 14C-TCIN CONSISTENT WITH A DETOXICATION ROLE FOR GSH-TCIN CONJUGATION.

WHEREAS STREAM POPULATIONS WERE DOMINATED BY 0+, 1+ AND 2+ AGE-CLASS FISH, LAKE POPULATIONS HAD A SMALLER PROPORTION OF THESE YOUNGER INDIVIDUALS AND A LARGER PROPORTION OF AGE CLASSES OLDER THAN 2 +. GROWTH IN BOTH LAKE AND STREAM POPULATIONS WAS SLOW OVER WINTER AND MORE RAPID DURING SPRING AND SUMMER. THE MAJORITY OF FISH OF BOTH SEXES MATURED AT AGE TWO, IRRESPECTIVE OF SIZE, ALTHOUGH SOME LAKE-DWELLING MALES MATURED IN THEIR FIRST YEAR. GONADAL DEVELOPMENT COMMENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF SUMMER (DECEMBER) IN ALL POPULATIONS. SPAWNING IN STREAM-DWELLING POPULATIONS OCCURRED BEFORE WINTER (MAY) AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASING WATER TEMPERATURE AND PHOTOPERIOD. BY CONTRAST, LANDLOCKED POPULATIONS SPAWNED IN EARLY SPRING (SEPTEMBER), AT WHICH TIME BOTH TEMPERATURE AND PHOTOPERIOD WERE INCREASING. AT SPAWNING, LANDLOCKED FEMALES INVESTED MORE ENERGY IN REPRODUCTION THAN DID RIVERINE FEMALES. THIS APPEARED TO BE A FUNCTION OF LARGER EGG SIZE IN FEMALES FROM ONE LAKE POPULATION AND GREATER FECUNDITY IN FEMALES FROM THE OTHER. ALTHOUGH G. TRUTTACEUS FITS THE GENERAL LIFE-HISTORY MODEL FOR DIADROMOUS GALAXIIDS, HAVING RELATIVELY LARGE NUMBERS OF SMALL EGGS, THE SHIFT IN SPAWNING TIME FOR LANDLOCKED POPULATIONS, AND THE INTER-POPULATION VARIATIONS IN EGG SIZE AND FECUNDITY SUGGEST CONSIDERABLE FLEXIBILITY IN THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS SPECIES LIFE HISTORY. 1989, CSIRO.

ALTHOUGH FEW EXPLICIT DATA ARE AVAILABLE, IT APPEARS THAT ADDITION OF LARGE SALMONIDS HAS HAD HARMFUL IMPACTS ON SOME INDIGENOUS SPECIES, PARTICULARLY SEVERAL GALAXIIDS; THESE APPEAR TO RESULT FROM PREDATION AND COMPETITIVE EXCLUSION. INTERACTIONS MAY BE CHRONIC OR CATASTROPHIC. IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE CAUSES OF CHRONIC INTERACTIONS, MANY INSTANCES OF WHICH ARE LIKELY TO BE OCCURRING AND ESCAPING NOTICE. FURTHER, IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEPARATE THE EFFECTS OF HUMAN-INDUCED HABITAT DETERIORATION FROM INTER-SPECIFIC INTERACTIONS. CATASTROPHIC INTERACTIONS ARE MUCH EASIER TO OBSERVE BUT EVEN HERE DETERMINING THE NATURE OF INTERACTIONS AND ASCRIBING CAUSES IS FRAUGHT WITH DIFFICULTIES.","ALLEN PJ, 1971, NZ MARINE DEP FRESHW, V6, P1; ARMSTRONG JS, 1935, T P ROYAL SOC NZ, V65, P88; BEST ELSDON, 1929, DOMINION MUS BULL WELLINGTON, V12, P1; CALDERWOOD W.

LACUSTRINE FISH HAD FEWER DORSAL AND ANAL FIN RAYS THAN DID RIVERINE FISH. DIFFERENCES WERE NOT AS CLEAR FOR GILL RAKERS AND VERTEBRAE. COMPARISONS OF SERIAL COUNTS WERE MADE WITH TWO DERIVED LACUSTRINE SPECIES, G. AURATUS AND G. TANYCEPHALUS, ALSO FROM TASMANIA. LACUSTRINE G. TRUTTACEUS VARIED IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE DERIVED SPECIES, RELATIVE TO RIVERINE G. TRUTTACEUS. FROM AN ANALYSIS OF 12 BODY MEASUREMENTS, THE FIRST CANONICAL VARIATE CLEARLY SEPARATED LACUSTRINE FISH FROM RIVERINE FISH LARGELY BASED ON MEASUREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH FINS (PRE-ANAL FIN LENGTH, LENGTH OF ANAL BASE, PRE-DORSAL FIN LENGTH, MAXIMUM LENGTH OF DORSAL FIN AND INTER-ORBITAL WIDTH). AN OVERALL VALUE FOR THE CORRECT CLASSIFICATION OF FISH INTO GROUPS BASED ON LOCALITY WAS 84%. THE PERCENTAGE OF FISH CLASSIFIED INTO THE WRONG HABITAT (LAKE OR STREAM) WAS MUCH LESS THAN THE PERCENTAGE CLASSIFIED BETWEEN LOCALITIES WITHIN HABITATS.

TRIBUTARIES IN INDIGENOUS FOREST WERE NUMERICALLY DOMINATED BY BANDED KOKOPU (GALAXIAS FASCIATUS) AND LONGFINNED EEL (ANGUILLA DIEFFENBACHII), WITH REDFINNED BULLY (GOBIOMORPHUS HUTTONI) AND GIANT KOKOPU (G.

IT SPAWNS AT THE HEAD OF ESTUARIES IN AUTUMN AND THE LARVAE SPEND 3 MONTHS OF WINTER AT SEA BEFORE RETURNING TO FRESH WATER. IN TASMANIA THERE ARE LANDLOCKED POPULATIONS OF G. TRUTTACEUS IN A CLUSTER OF GEOLOGICALLY YOUNG LAKES ON THE RECENTLY GLACIATED CENTRAL PLATEAU. THESE POPULATIONS HAVE NO MARINE LARVAL STAGE AND SPAWN IN THE LAKES IN SPRING. SPECIATION DUE TO LAND LOCKING IS THOUGHT TO BE A FREQUENT OCCURRENCE WITHIN GALAXIAS. TO INVESTIGATE THE NATURE OF THE SPECIATION EVENT WHICH MAY BE OCCURRING WITHIN LAKE POPULATIONS OF G. TRUTTACEUS WE STUDIED THE MITOCHONDRIAL DNA (MTDNA) AND ALLOZYME DIVERSITY OF BOTH LAKE AND STREAM POPULATIONS. USING THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF RESTRICTION SITES RECOGNIZED BY 13 SIX-BASE RESTRICTION ENDONUCLEASES, WE FOUND 58 MTDNA HAPLOTYPES AMONG 150 FISH COLLECTED FROM 13 TASMANIAN AND ONE SOUTH-EAST AUSTRALIAN MAINLAND STREAM POPULATIONS. THE MOST PARSIMONIOUS NETWORK RELATING THE HAPLOTYPES BY SITE LOSS OR GAIN WAS STARLIKE IN SHAPE. WE ARGUE THAT THIS ARRANGEMENT IS BEST EXPLAINED BY SELECTION UPON SLIGHTLY BENEFICIAL MUTATIONS WITHIN THE MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME. GENE DIVERSITY ANALYSIS UNDER WRIGHT'S ISLAND MODEL SHOWED THAT THE POPULATIONS IN EACH DRAINAGE WERE NOT GENETICALLY SUBDIVIDED. ONLY TWO OF THESE STREAM HAPLOTYPES WERE FOUND AMONG THE 66 FISH ANALYZED FROM FOUR LAKE POPULATIONS. DESPITE THE EXTREME LACK OF MTDNA DIVERSITY IN LAKE POPULATIONS, THE OBSERVED NUCLEAR DNA HETEROZYGOSITY OF 40 LAKE FISH (0.10355) WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY LESS THAN THAT OF 82 STREAM FISH (0.11635). IN THE SHORT TIME (3000-7000 YEARS) THAT THE LAKE FISH HAVE BEEN LANDLOCKED, RANDOM GENETIC DRIFT IN A FINITE, STABLE-SIZED POPULATION WAS PROBABLY NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LACK OF MTDNA DIVERSITY IN THE LAKE POPULATIONS. WE INFER THE LAKE POPULATIONS HAVE PROBABLY EXPERIENCED AT LEAST ONE, SEVERE, BUT TRANSITORY BOTTLENECK POSSIBLY INDUCED BY NATURAL SELECTION FOR LIFE-HISTORY CHARACTERS ESSENTIAL FOR SURVIVAL IN THE LACUSTRINE HABITAT.

WE FOUND A TOTAL OF TWELVE SPECIES OF NATIVE FISH, AND TWO INTRODUCED SPECIES (RAINBOW AND BROWN TROUT), AT STUDY SITES IN UPLAND NATIVE FOREST AND LOWLAND PASTORAL AREAS. AT MOST SITES THE FISH COMMUNITY WAS RELATIVELY DEPAUPERATE, BOTH IN SPECIES DIVERSITY AND IN ABUNDANCE. ONLY LONGFIRMED EEL WAS FOUND AT THE MAJORITY (92\%) OF SITES, WHILE OTHER SPECIES WERE RECORDED FROM A MINIMUM OF 2\% (INANGA) TO A MAXIMUM OF 30\% (COMMON BULLY) OF SITES. OVER HALF OF ALL NATIVE FISH SPECIES WERE RECORDED AT FEWER THAN 10\% OF ALL SITES; SPECIES IN THE FAMILY GALAXIIDAE WERE RECORDED FROM ONLY 7\% OF SITES. LARGE GALAXIID SPECIES (HANDED, GIANT AND SHORT-JAWED KOKOPU AND KOARO) WERE VERY SPARSELY DISTRIBUTED AND LOW IN ABUNDANCE AT MOST SITES, AND WERE GENERALLY ABSENT FROM LOWLAND PASTORAL SITES, WHERE THE FISH COMMUNITY WAS DOMINATED BY EELS AND COMMON BULLY. RAINBOW AND BROWN TROUT WERE QUITE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE STUDY AREA. WE CONSIDER THAT ONLY TWO SPECIES OF NATIVE FISH (LONGFINNED EEL AND COMMON BULLY) COULD BE CLASSIFIED INTO THE IUCN CONSERVATION STATUS OF COMMON, WHILE TWO SPECIES (REDFINNED BULLY, CRAN'S BULLY) WERE RARE, AND FOUR SPECIES (BANDED KOKOPU, GIANT KOKOPU, SHORTJAWED KOKOPU, KOARO) APPEAR TO BE EITHER VULNERABLE OR ENDANGERED. HABITAT LOSS AND DEGRADATION, MAINLY THROUGH DEFORESTATION AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT, APPEAR TO BE THE MAIN EXPLANATIONS FOR THE DECLINE OF NATIVE FISH IN WAIKATO TRIBUTARIES, BUT OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS PREDATION AND COMPETITION FROM INTRODUCED SPECIES OF EXOTIC FISH AND OVERFISHING OF WHITEBAIT IN THE LOWER REACHES OF THE RIVER, MAY POSSIBLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROBLEM.","ALLEN K.

IN THE WAIPEHI STREAM, KOARO CONSUMED BOTH RAINBOW TROUT OVA AND KOARO OVA; IN OMORI STREAM, TROUT OVA WERE IMPORTANT IN THE DIET OF JUVENILE RAINBOW TROUT. SINCE THE DIETS OF KOARO AND JUVENILE RAINBOW TROUT IN SOME TAUPO TRIBUTARIES ARE SIMILAR, POPULATIONS MAY COEXIST BY TEMPORAL AND/OR SPATIAL PARTITIONING OF FOOD RESOURCES, WHEREAS TROUT PREDATION ON SMALL KOARO MAY BE A LIMITING FACTOR FOR KOARO POPULATIONS.

AS KOARO CO-EXIST WITH BULLIES IN OTHER LAKES, BUT HAVE DECLINED IN LANDLOCKED LAKES CONTAINING SMELT, THE DISAPPEARANCE OF KOARO IN LAKE ROTOPOUNAMU IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE INTRODUCTION OF SMELT ALONE. INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION FOR FOOD BETWEEN 0 + YEAR OLD KOARO AND SMELT, COMBINED WITH PREDATION BY 2 + YEAR OLD SMELT ON KOARO LARVAE, ARE THOUGHT TO BE RESPONSIBLE. SUCH A MECHANISM WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS OF PREDATOR-PREY REGULATION SYSTEMS WITHIN SAME CHAIN FOOD WEBS. RAINBOW TROUT, ONCORHYNCHUS MYKISS, WHICH WERE INTRODUCED INTO A NUMBER OF LOCAL LAKES BEFORE SMELT, AND WHICH PREYED ON THE KOARO, HAVE BEEN BLAMED FOR THE DECLINE OF THE KOARO POPULATIONS.

TRUTTACEUS WERE USED TO COMPARE STREAMS WITH AND WITHOUT BROWN TROUT. IN SELECTED STREAMS IN SOUTHEAST TASMANIA, HABITAT USE BY G. TRUTTACEUS WAS EXAMINED WITH RESPECT TO FOUR PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS EXTRACTED FROM EIGHT HABITAT VARIABLES. DIFFERENT SIZE-CLASSES OF G. TRUTTACEUS DISPLAYED VARYING NONRANDOM PATTERNS OF HABITAT USE, SHIFTING FROM SHALLOW, OPEN HABITATS TO DEEP, COVER-RICH HABITATS WITH INCREASING SIZE. ALL SIZE-CLASSES PREFERRED SLOW-FLOWING SECTIONS TO FAST-FLOWING SECTIONS. POPULATION ABUNDANCE MODELS WERE CONSTRUCTED FOR THREE SIZE-CLASSES OF G. TRUTTACEUS. AND GIVEN THE HYDROLOGICALLY VARIABLE NATURE OF THE STREAMS STUDIED, ALL OF THE MODELS WERE REASONABLY SUCCESSFUL IN EXPLAINING VARIATION. THE APPLICATION OF THE MODELS TO STREAMS CONTAINING BROWN TROUT INDICATED THAT THE PRESENCE OF BROWN TROUT WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS IN DETERMINING THE ABUNDANCE OF G.

AN INTENSIVE STUDY OF THE TAIERI RIVER HAS REVEALED THAT SEVERAL NATIVE GALAXIID FISHES ARE NOW RESTRICTED TO HEADWATERS ABOVE LARGE WATERFALLS THAT PREVENT THE UPSTREAM MIGRATION OF BROWN TROUT. BROWN TROUT MAY PROFOUNDLY AFFECT THE FUNCTIONING OF STREAM COMMUNITIES, REDUCING THE ABUNDANCE OF GRAZING INVERTEBRATES AND ALTERING THEIR GRAZING BEHAVIOUR SO THAT ALGAL BIOMASS INCREASES. A TROPHIC CASCADE WAS PREDICTABLE ON THE BASIS OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF RITE INVADER AND OF THE STREAM COMMUNITY. BROWN TROUT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EVOLUTION AMONG INVERTEBRATES OF NOVEL ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOURS WITH FAR-REACHING COMMUNITY CONSEQUENCES. THE ECOLOGICAL AND EVOLUTIONARY CONSEQUENCES THE INTRODUCTION OF BROWN TROUT NEW ZEALAND ARE PROBABLY REVERSIBLE.

FROM COMPARISONS OF MEAN DELTA(13)C AND DELTA(15)N VALUES, FOOD WEBS IN THE SHADED, FOREST STREAMS WERE CLEARLY BASED ON ALLOCHTHONOUS MATERIAL (CONDITIONED LEAF LITTER AND TERRESTRIAL INVERTEBRATES). AUTOTROPHS IN FOREST STREAMS WERE NOT A SIGNIFICANT C SOURCE FOR THE FOOD WEBS. HOWEVER, THE C SOURCE OF FOOD WEBS IN THE UNSHADED PASTURE STREAMS APPEARED TO BE A MIXTURE OF ALLOCHTHONOUS AND AUTOCHTHONOUS MATERIAL. CONDITIONED LEAF LITTER APPEARED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE PASTURE STREAM FOOD WEBS, AND THE DELTA(13)C AND DELTA(15)N OF SOME SAMPLES OF EPILITHIC DIATOMS INDICATED THEIR CONSUMPTION BY INVERTEBRATES IN PASTURE STREAMS. FISH ATE A WIDE RANGE OF AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES; LONGFINNED EELS (ANGUILLA DIEFFENBACHII) AND BANDED KOKOPU (GALAXIAS FASCIATUS) ALSO HAD A LARGE PROPORTION OF TERRESTRIAL INVERTEBRATES IN THEIR DIET.

THE WIDE RANGE OF DELTA(13)C VALUES OF FILAMENTOUS GREEN ALGAE (-18.8 TO -29.7 PARTS PER THOUSAND) COMPLICATED UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR ROLE IN THE STREAM FOOD WEBS. THE DELTA(13)C VALUES OF CLADOPHORA WERE RELATED TO WATER VELOCITY, WITH MORE C-13-ENRICHED VALUES IN POOLS THAN IN RUNS (-23.2 PARTS PER THOUSAND IN POOLS, MEAN VELOCITY 0.12 M S(-1); -28.1 PARTS PER THOUSAND IN RUNS, MEAN VELOCITY 0.24 M S(-1)).

LARGE AREAS OF NATIVE FOREST WERE CONVERTED TO PASTURE AND FEW LARGE AREAS OF UNMODIFIED FOREST REMAIN. TROUT (SALMO TRUTTA AND ONCORHYNCHUS MYKISS) WERE INTRODUCED INTO THE RIVERS AT THE SAME TIME, AND THESE TWO CHANGES ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE AFFECTED NATIVE FISH COMMUNITIES. KAHURANGI NATIONAL PARK IS A LARGE AREA OF UNMODIFIED NATIVE FOREST WITH FEW INTRODUCED TROUT IN SMALLER RIVERS DRAINING TO THE WEST. A SURVEY OF THESE STREAMS WAS MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEIR COMMUNITIES DIFFERED FROM THOSE IN OTHER AREAS OF NEW ZEALAND. NO NON-DIADROMOUS NATIVE FISH WERE FOUND, SUGGESTING A BIOGEOGRAPHIC SEPARATION FROM ADJACENT EASTERN AND SOUTHERN AREAS SINCE THE PLIOCENE OR EARLY PLEISTOCENE. CONTRARY TO POPULAR EXPECTATION, FISH DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE WAS OFTEN LOWER THAN AT EQUIVALENT ELEVATIONS IN OTHER AREAS OF NEW ZEALAND. LOWLAND FISH COMMUNITIES COMPRISED A SMALL STREAM COMMUNITY DOMINATED BY INANGA (GALAXIAS MACULATUS), A SMALL STREAM COMMUNITY CONTAINING A MIXED GALAXIID POPULATION BUT DOMINATED BY BANDED KOKOPU (GALAXIAS FASCIATUS), AND TWO LARGE STREAM COMMUNITIES CONTAINING THE FASTWATER SPECIES BLUEGILLED BULLY (GOBIOMORPHUS HUBBSI), AND DOMINATED BY EITHER REDFINNED BULLY (GOBIOMORPHUS HUTTONI) OR BLUEGILLED BULLY. LARGE STREAMS USUALLY CONTAINED NO IN-STREAM COVER WITH MARGINS OF EXPOSED STREAMBED, WHEREAS SMALL STREAMS CONTAINED PLENTIFUL COVER WITH MARGINS OF NATIVE FOREST, NATIVE GRASSES, OR SWAMP. UPLAND FISH COMMUNITIES WERE DOMINATED BY KOARO (GALAXIAS BREVIPINNIS) AND/OR LONGFINNED EELS (ANGUILLA DIEFFENBACHII). LARGE-STREAM FISH COMMUNITIES IN KAHURANGI NATIONAL PARK WERE SIMILAR TO THE.FASTWATER COMMUNITIES IN MEDIUM-LARGE RIVERS IN OTHER AREAS OF NEW ZEALAND.

MEAN FEEDING RATES FOR BANDED KOKOPU (GALAXIAS FASCIATUS), SMELT (RETROPINNA RETROPINNA), INANGA (G. MACULATUS), AND COMMON BULLIES (GOBIOMORPHUS COTIDIANUS) WERE ALL REDUCED BY INCREASED TURBIDITY, BUT SIGNIFICANTLY SO ONLY FOR BANDED KOKOPU AND INANGA. BANDED KOKOPU WAS THE MOST SENSITIVE SPECIES AS FEEDING RATES AT 20 NTU WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN IN CLEAR WATER, COMPARED WITH LEVELS OVER 160 NTU FOR THE OTHER SPECIES. FEEDING RATES FOR REDFINNED BULLIES (GOBIOMORPHUS HUTTONI) INCREASED WITH TURBIDITY UP TO 40 NTU THEN DECREASED. REDUCTIONS IN FEEDING RATE AT ELEVATED TURBIDITY LEVELS WERE THE RESULT OF A REDUCED INABILITY TO FEED, RATHER THAN TO STRESS, AS EXPOSURE TO THE HIGHEST TURBIDITY LEVEL DID NOT REDUCE FEEDING MOTIVATION OR APPETITE. FEEDING TESTS IN THE DARK INDICATED THAT, WHEREAS VISION WAS IMPORTANT FOR FEEDING BY ALL SPECIES, BANDED KOKOPU AND COMMON BULLIES HAD A COMPARATIVELY WELL-DEVELOPED ABILITY TO FEED USING NON-VISUAL SENSES.

HOWEVER, THE ABILITY TO LEARN DAILY PATTERNS OF PRE DATION RISK AND MOVE BETWEEN AREAS AT THE RIGHT TIME OF DAY IN ORDER TO AVOID PREDATION HAS NEVER BEEN TESTED. THIS STUDY ASKED WHETHER INANGAS, GALAXIAS MACULATUS, ARE CAPABLE OF TIME-PLACE LEARNING BASED ON FOOD AVAILABILITY ONLY, PREDATION RISK ONLY, OR THE ANTAGONISTIC COMBINATION OF FOOD AVAILABILITY AND PREDATION RISK. SHOALS OF FIVE INANGAS WERE KEPT IN AQUARIA PARTIALLY DIVIDED INTO A RIGHT AND LEFT SECTION. EVERY DAY THEY WERE EXPOSED TO A STIMULUS ON ONE SIDE IN THE MORNING AND ON THE OTHER SIDE IN THE AFTERNOON. DEPENDING ON THE EXPERIMENT, THE STIMULUS COULD BE TWO DELIVERIES OF FOOD, TWO SIMULATED HERON STRIKES, OR BOTH OF THE ABOVE WITHIN THE SAME HOUR. AFTER 14 D THE STIMULI WERE NOT GIVEN AND THE POSITION OF THE FISH WAS NOTED IN BOTH THE MORNING AND THE AFTERNOON. THE MAJORITY OF THE FISH LEARNED TO SWITCH SIDES AT THE CORRECT DAILY TIME IN ORDER TO GET FOOD, BUT THEY REMAINED ON THE SAME SIDE AT BOTH DAILY TIMES IN RESPONSE TO EITHER PREDATION RISK ALONE OR THE COMBINATION OF PREDATION RISK AND FOOD. IT SEEMS THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR TIME-PLACE LEARNING BASED ON PREDATION RISK IS LESS THAN THAT BASED ON FOOD, AND THAT PREDATION RISK CAN EVEN CURTAIL THE EXPRESSION OF TIME-PLACE LEARNING BASED ON FOOD. FISH MAY RESORT TO OTHER TACTICS, SUCH AS SHOALING AND REDUCED MOVEMENT, IN RESPONSE TO PREDATION RISK. DAILY HABITAT SHIFTS COULD STILL BE PRESENT IN NATURE AND ROOTED IN THE AVOIDANCE OF PREDATION, BUT INSTEAD OF BEING THE DIRECT RESULT OF LEARNING THEY WOULD BE MOSTLY INNATE.","BIEBACH H, 1989, ANIM BEHAV, V37, P353, DOI 10.1016/0003-3472(89)90083-3; BIEBACH H, 1991, J BIOL RHYTHM, V6, P353, DOI 10.1177/074873049100600406; BOLLES RC, 1974, BEHAV BIOL, V11, P365, DOI 10.1016/S0091-6773(74)90633-6; BOULOS Z, 1990, PHYSIOL BEHAV, V48, P523, DOI 10.1016/0031-9384(90)90294-E; BOWEN SH, 1982, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V7, P357, DOI 10.1007/BF00005570; CARR JAR, 1997, J EXP PSYCHOL ANIM B, V23, P232, DOI 10.1037/0097-7403.23.2.232; CARROLL A.

MULTIPLE-PASS ELECTRIC FISHING WAS USED TO DETERMINE FISH DENSITIES, AND DIFFERENCES IN FISH COMMUNITY STRUCTURE BETWEEN LAND USES WERE DETECTED USING NONMETRIC MULTI-DIMENSIONAL SCALING ANALYSIS. SPECIES RESPONSIBLE FOR CHANGES IN FISH COMMUNITY STRUCTURE WERE IDENTIFIED BY COMPARING SPECIES DENSITIES BETWEEN LAND USES. SIX FISH SPECIES OCCURRED COMMONLY WITHIN EACH DRAINAGE SYSTEM AND ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN FISH COMMUNITY STRUCTURE BETWEEN STREAMS IN NATIVE OR EXOTIC FOREST, DIFFERENCES OCCURRED BETWEEN THE FISH COMMUNITIES OF FORESTED AND PASTORAL STREAMS. PASTORAL STREAMS CONTAINED MORE SHORTFINNED EELS (ANGUILLA AUSTRALIS), MORE INANGA (GALAXIAS MACULATUS), AND FEWER BANDED KOKOPU (GALAXIAS FASCIATUS) THAN FORESTED STREAMS. FISH BIOMASS WAS ALSO HIGHER IN PASTORAL STREAMS. WE CONCLUDED THAT THE TYPE OF FOREST (MATURE EXOTIC PINE VERSUS MIXED-SPECIES INDIGENOUS) HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON THE NATIVE FISH POPULATIONS, BUT THAT PASTURE SUPPORTED AN INCREASED FISH DENSITY AND BIOMASS DUE MAINLY TO INCREASES IN SHORTFINNED EELS. THERE WERE FEWER BANDED KOKOPU IN PASTURE THAN IN FORESTED STREAMS, BUT EXOTIC FOREST STREAMS CONTAINED AS MANY BANDED KOKOPU AS NATIVE FOREST STREAMS.","ANGERMEIER PL, 1989, ECOLOGY, V70, P1450, DOI 10.2307/1938204; ARMOUR CL, 1983, FWSOBS8233; BOUBEE JAT, 1997, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V31, P61, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1997.9516745; CLARKE KR, 1993, AUST J ECOL, V18, P117, DOI 10.1111/J.1442-9993.1993.TB00438.X; GORMAN OT, 1978, ECOLOGY, V59, P507, DOI 10.2307/1936581; GRAYNOTH E, 1979, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V13, P79, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1979.9515783; GROWNS I.

ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST WIDESPREAD FRESHWATER FISH,MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,NA,"BIOGEOGRAPHIC CONTROVERSIES SURROUNDING THE WIDESPREAD FRESHWATER FISH, GALAXIAS MACULATUS, WERE ADDRESSED WITH DNA SEQUENCE DATA. MITOCHONDRIAL CYTOCHROME B AND 16S RRNA SEQUENCES WERE OBTAINED FROM REPRESENTATIVES OF SIX POPULATIONS OF THIS SPECIES. SUBSTANTIAL LEVELS OF CYTOCHROME B (MAXIMUM 14.6\%) AND 168 RRNA SEQUENCE DIVERGENCE (MAXIMUM 6.0\%) WERE DETECTED BETWEEN WESTERN PACIFIC (TASMANIA-NEW ZEALAND) AND SOUTH AMERICAN (CHILE-FALKLAND ISLANDS) HAPLOTYPES. A CONSIDERABLE LEVEL OF DIVERGENCE WAS ALSO DETECTED BETWEEN TASMANIAN AND NEW ZEALAND HAPLOTYPES (MAXIMUM 5.1\%) AND WITHIN AND AMONG: CHILEAN AND FALKLAND ISLAND G. MACULATUS (MAXIMUM 3.8\%). THE PHYLOGENETIC STRUCTURE OF HAPLOTYPES CONFLICTS WITH THE ACCEPTED PATTERN OF CONTINENTAL FRAGMENTATION. MOLECULAR CLOCK CALIBRATIONS SUGGEST THAT HAPLOTYPE DIVERGENCES POSTDATE THE FRAGMENTATION OF GONDWANA. THESE FINDINGS POINT TO MARINE DISPERSAL RATHER THAN ANCIENT VICARIANCE AS AN EXPLANATION FOR THE WIDE DISTRIBUTION. THE PHYLOGENETIC STRUCTURE OF SOUTH AMERICAN HAPLOTYPES WAS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THEIR GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.

HABITAT ASSESSMENTS INDICATED THAT BED STABILITY WAS CLOSELY RELATED TO TOTAL FISH BIOMASS. EXOTIC TROUT WERE NOT PRESENT AT THE MOST UNSTABLE SITES BUT INHABITED MOST MEDIUM TO LARGE STREAMS WITH STABLE BEDS. GALAXIIDS (GALAXIAS VULGARIS, GALAXIAS BREVIPINNIS, AND GALAXIAS PAUCISPONDYLUS) OCCURRED AT SITES THAT SPANNED ALMOST THE ENTIRE RANGE OF HABITAT CONDITIONS AND CO-OCCURRED WITH TROUT MORE FREQUENTLY AT INTERMEDIATE LEVELS OF BED STABILITY. HOWEVER, GALAXIIDS WERE ABSENT FROM ALL SITES WITH LARGE (> 150-MM FORK LENGTH (FL)) BROWN (SALMO TRUTTA) AND RAINBOW (ONCORHYNCHUS MYKISS) TROUT. THESE STREAMS TENDED TO BE LARGER, WITH MORE STABLE BEDS. IN A FIELD TANK EXPERIMENT, LARGE BROWN TROUT CONSUMED CANTERBURY GALAXIAS (G. VULGARIS), RANGING IN SIZE FROM 48- TO 94-MM FL, AT A MUCH HIGHER RATE THAN DID SMALL TROUT. THEIR PREDATION OF GALAXIIDS APPEARED NOT TO BE SIZE SELECTIVE, SO THERE WAS NO SIZE REFUGE FOR GALAXIIDS FROM PREDATION BY LARGE TROUT. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT PREDATION BY LARGE TROUT HAS LIKELY ELIMINATED SMALL-BODIED GALAXIIDS FROM MANY STREAMS BUT THAT TROUT IMPACT IS LIMITED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF HABITATS SUITABLE FOR LARGE INDIVIDUALS.","AULT TR, 1994, T AM FISH SOC, V123, P939, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(1994)123<0939:EOHSAT>2.3.CO;2; BALTZ DM, 1993, ECOL APPL, V3, P246, DOI 10.2307/1941827; BAYLEY PB, 1992, RIVERS HDB, V1, P251; CLOSS GP, 1996, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V47, P17, DOI 10.1007/BF00002376; COLLIER K., 1992, 131 DEP CONS; COWIE B, 1986, WAIMAKARIRI RIVER CA, V1; COWX IG, 1983, FISH MANAGE, V14, P67; CROWL T.A., 1992, REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES, V2, P217, DOI 10.1007/BF00045038; DEATH RG, 1994, J N AM BENTHOL SOC, V13, P125, DOI 10.2307/1467232; ELTON CS, 1958, ECOLOGY INVASIONS; GLOVA G.

A LIMITED FISH FAUNA WAS RECORDED (SIX SPECIES), INCLUDING THREE THREATENED LARGE GALAXIID SPECIES (GALAXIAS ARGENTEUS, GALAXIAS FASCIATUS, AND GALAXIAS BREVIPINNIS), WHICH HAVE RESTRICTED DISTRIBUTIONS ON MAINLAND NEW ZEALAND. RESULTS INDICATED THAT THESE LARGE GALAXIIDS OCCUPY DIVERSE HABITATS INCLUDING POOLS AND BACKWATERS WITHIN THE MAINSTEMS OF THIS STREAM. THEIR EXTENSIVE DISTRIBUTIONS AND WIDE HABITAT USAGE WERE ATTRIBUTED TO FACTORS SUCH AS THE INTACT CATCHMENT VEGETATION, UNMODIFIED STREAM CHANNEL, AND THE ABSENCE OF INTRODUCED FISHES, PARTICULARLY SALMONIDS. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SOME NATIVE SPECIES HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM MAINSTEM HABITATS ELSEWHERE IN NEW ZEALAND. IT WAS ALSO EVIDENT THAT INTERACTIONS AMONG THE NATIVE SPECIES INFLUENCED HABITAT USE; G. BREVIPINNIS AVOIDED BACKWATERS, RUNS, AND POOLS IN REACHES OCCUPIED BY G. FASCIATUS AND ANGUILLA DIEFFENBACHII; WHEREAS G. FASCIATUS APPEARED TO AVOID HABITATS OCCUPIED BY G. ARGENTEUS AND A. DIEFFENBACHII. MAXIMUM DENSITIES AND BIOMASS OF GALAXIIDS AND EELS OCCURRED IN DEEPWATER HABITATS (> 0.75 M). FURTHERMORE THE FISH INHABITING THESE DEEP ER WATERS WERE LARGER AND MORE LIKELY TO BE FEMALE.

THIRTEEN SPECIES OF FISH WERE CAUGHT, WITH SEVEN OF THEM COMPRISING MAJOR POPULATIONS, ALTHOUGH ONLY FOUR OF THESE WERE ADEQUATELY SAMPLED BY THE METHOD USED-THEY INCLUDED INANGA (GALAXIAS MACULATUS), COMMON SMELT (RETROPINNA RETROPINNA), SHORTFINNED EEL (ANGUILLA AUSTRALIS), AND COMMON BULLY (GOBIOMORPHUS COTIDIANUS). INANGA WERE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY CONFINED TO AREAS ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE LAKE WHICH HAS A CONVOLUTED SHORELINE WITH A VARIETY OF SMALL EMBAYMENTS WITH SCATTERED VEGETATION ALONG THE MARGINS. COMMON SMELT OCCUPIED BOTH MARGINAL AND OFFSHORE AREAS, BUT THEY TOO WERE MORE ABUNDANT ALONG THE MARGINS PARTICULARLY ON THE WESTERN SIDE. BOTH THE COMMON BULLY AND SHORTFINNED EEL WERE WIDESPREAD AND ABUNDANT IN THE LAKE, ALTHOUGH THEIR ABUNDANCE AND BIOMASS WERE HIGHER WITHIN THE VICINITY OF THE LAKE OUTLET, MAJOR INFLOWING TRIBUTARIES, AND OTHER MARGINAL HABITATS. ALL THREE SPECIES OF FLOUNDERS OF THE GENUS RHOMBOSOLEA WERE POORLY REPRESENTED IN OUR SAMPLES. HOWEVER, IN COMMERCIAL CATCHES THEY WERE REASONABLY ABUNDANT, WITH THE SAND FLOUNDER (R, PLEBEIA) AND YELLOWBELLY (R. LEPORINA) BEING MORE COMMON IN OFFSHORE THAN INSHORE CATCHES, WHEREAS THE BLACK FLOUNDER (R. RETIARIA) SHOWED NO DIFFERENCE IN THE CATCHES BETWEEN AREAS. OUR OVERALL FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE HYPOTHESIS THAT BOTTOM-DWELLING SPECIES (EELS, BULLIES, FLOUNDERS) ARE MORE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED THAN FREE-SWIMMING FORMS (INANGA, COMMON SMELT), WHICH WERE LARGELY CONFINED TO AREAS SHELTERED FROM PREVAILING WINDS.

ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION (UVR) DAMAGES EARLY LIFE STAGES OF SEVERAL FISH SPECIES. GALAXIAS MACULATUS IS A SMALL CATADROMOUS FISH, WITH LANDLOCKED FORMS OCCURRING IN MANY LAKES WITHIN THE NAHUEL HUAPI NATIONAL PARK (PATAGONIA, ARGENTINA). TN THIS WORK, THE VULNERABILITY OF G. MACULATUS EGGS EXPOSED TO BOTH NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL UVR WAS INVESTIGATED IN RELATION TO WATER TRANSPARENCY. 2. FIELD EXPERIMENTS WERE PERFORMED IN TWO LAKES DIFFERING IN UVR ATTENUATION. GALAXIAS MACULATUS EGGS WERE EXPOSED TO IN SITU LEVELS OF UVR IN QUARTZ TUBES INCUBATED AT VARIOUS DEPTHS. FOR LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS, THE EGGS WERE EXPOSED TO FIVE LEVELS OF ARTIFICIAL UVB RADIATION. 3. EXPOSURE TO NATURAL UVR CAUSES VARIOUS DEGREES OF EGG MORTALITY DEPENDING ON WATER TRANSPARENCY AND INCUBATION DEPTH. IN THE LESS TRANSPARENT LAKE (K-D320 = 3.08 M(-1)), ALMOST COMPLETE MORTALITY WAS OBSERVED NEAR THE SURFACE. AT A DEPTH OF 43 CM THE OBSERVED MORTALITY WAS ONLY 22\%, BUT WAS STILL SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE DARK CONTROL. IN THE MOST TRANSPARENT LAKE (K-D320 = 0.438 M(-1)), ALMOST TOTAL MORTALITY WAS OBSERVED IN TUBES INCUBATED AT 2.56 M OR SHALLOWER. A GRADUAL DECLINE IN MORTALITY WAS RECORDED FROM THAT DEPTH TO 3.78 M WHERE THE VALUES APPROACHED THOSE IN THE DARK CONTROL TREATMENTS. 4. A MONOTONIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MORTALITY AND UV EXPOSURE COULD BE OBSERVED BOTH IN FIELD AND LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS. USING THE RESULTS FROM FIELD INCUBATIONS, A LD50 OF 2.5 J CM(-2) NM(-1) WAS ESTIMATED. IN A FEW MOUNTAIN LAKES, THIS VALUE WOULD BE EXCEEDED EVEN IF THE EGGS WERE LAID AT THE MAXIMUM DEPTH OF THE LAKE. THUS UVR SEEMS A SUFFICIENT CAUSE TO EXPLAIN THE ABSENCE OF G. MACULATUS POPULATIONS IN SOME MOUNTAIN LAKES. FOR MOST LAKES, HOWEVER, UVR IS PROBABLY ONE OF SEVERAL IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, WHICH TOGETHER DETERMINE THE HABITAT SUITABILITY.","BARRIGA JP, 1999, LARVAS GENERO GALAXI; BELAND F, 1999, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V56, P1058, DOI 10.1139/CJFAS-56-6-1058; BELL MARY G., 1950, CANADIAN JOUR RES SECT D ZOOL SCI, V28, P35; CROWDER LB, 1984, T AM FISH SOC, V113, P694, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(1984)113\&LT;694:ESIRUB\&GT;2.0.CO;2; CUSSAC VE, 1992, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V35, P141, DOI 10.1007/BF00002189; HUNTER JR, 1979, PHOTOCHEM PHOTOBIOL, V29, P325, DOI 10.1111/J.1751-1097.1979.TB07055.X; HUNTER JR, 1981, PHOTOCHEM PHOTOBIOL, V34, P477, DOI 10.1111/J.1751-1097.1981.TB09028.X; HUNTER JR, 1982, NATO C SERIES, V4, P459; MCDOWALL RM, 1968, FISHERIES RES B, V2, P84; MORRIS DP, 1995, LIMNOL OCEANOGR, V40, P1381, DOI 10.4319/LO.1995.40.8.1381; WILLIAMSON CE, 1997, ECOL APPL, V7, P1017, DOI 10.1890/1051-0761(1997)0071017:SURATS2.0.CO;2; ZAGARESE HE, 2000, IN PRESS VERHANDLUNG; ZAGARESE HE, 2000, IN PRESS EFFECTS UV",10.1046/J.1365-2427.2000.00600.X,26,ARGENTINA;ARGENTINA;ARGENTINA;ARGENTINA;ARGENTINA,267,TERTIARY,UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL DEL COMAHUE,ARGENTINA,PATAGONIA,N,Y,N,N,N,N,REGIONAL,0.6,N,NA,NA,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,UV EXPOSURE,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,Y

IF JUVENILE MIGRANTS AVOID WATERS MADE TURBID BY SS AND THEIR RECRUITMENT TO ADULT HABITATS UP STREAM IS REDUCED, THEN ADULT ABUNDANCE MAY DECLINE IN TURBID RIVERS. TO TEST THIS, WE COMPARED THE ABUNDANCE OF DIADROMOUS NATIVE FISH BETWEEN TURBID AND CLEAR RIVERS. THE DURATION (% TIME) FOR WHICH SS CONCENTRATIONS EXCEEDED 120 MG LITRE-1 (A CRITICAL LEVEL FROM LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS) DURING THE MIGRATION SEASON (AUGUST-DECEMBER) WAS ESTIMATED FOR OVER 150 NEW ZEALAND RIVER SITES. TURBID RIVERS WERE DEFINED AS THOSE WHERE SS CONCENTRATIONS EXCEEDED 120 MG LITRE-1 FOR OVER 20% OF THE TIME AND CLEAR RIVERS AS THOSE WHERE SS CONCENTRATIONS EXCEEDED 120 MG LITRE-1 FOR LESS THAN 10% OF THE TIME. EIGHT TURBID RIVERS AND SEVEN CLEAR ONES WERE IDENTIFIED WHERE SUFFICIENT DATA ON SS AND NATIVE FISH POPULATIONS EXISTED TO PERMIT A COMPARISON. THE MEAN OCCURRENCE OF BANDED KOKOPU WAS REDUCED BY 89.5% IN TURBID RIVERS AND, ALTHOUGH OTHER DIADROMOUS FISH SPECIES WERE ALSO LESS COMMON, BANDED KOKOPU WAS MOST AFFECTED. DENSITIES OF ADULT BANDED KOKOPU WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN OPTIMAL STREAM HABITATS IN THREE TURBID COMPARED WITH THREE MATCHED CLEAR RIVERS. WE THEREFORE CONCLUDED THAT THE ABUNDANCE OF ADULT BANDED KOKOPU WAS REDUCED IN TURBID RIVERS AND PROPOSE THAT THIS IS BECAUSE OF REDUCED RECRUITMENT OF JUVENILES IN TURBID RIVERS. 2000, COPYRIGHT TAYLOR &AMP;

AT A HIGH CONCENTRATION THE MIGRATORY RESPONSE OF WHITEBAIT WAS RETARDED WITH THE MAJORITY OF FISH NOT MOVING UPSTREAM BUT REMAINING IN THE LOWER SECTION OF THE APPARATUS. THERE WAS NO RESPONSE TO ODOURS FROM ADULTS OF OTHER GALAXIID SPECIES, THE INANGA G. MACULATUS OR KOARO G. BREVIPINNIS AT ANY CONCENTRATION. THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE G.

FIELD TRIALS USING JUVENILE FISH COLLECTED FROM THE TARAWERA RIVER AND HAYS STREAM, NEW ZEALAND, WERE USED TO TEST THE RESULTS FROM THESE LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS BY MEASURING THE EFFECTS OF TURBIDITY ON THE MIGRATION DIRECTION AND RATE FOR BANDED KOKOPU IN A NATURAL STREAM SETTING. IN THE STREAM SETTING, NEITHER THE MIGRATION RATE NOR THE MIGRATION DIRECTION WERE AFFECTED AT TURBIDITY < 25 NTU. AT HIGHER TURBIDITY LEVELS, SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER FISH MIGRATED UP STREAM WITHIN A GIVEN TIME PERIOD. BECAUSE THERE WAS RARELY ANY DOWNSTREAM MOVEMENT, THIS SUGGESTS THE FISH EITHER HALTED OR SLOWED THEIR UPSTREAM MOVEMENT. A SLOWER RATE OF MIGRATION COULD RESULT IN FEWER JUVENILES REACHING ADULT HABITAT, AND WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THE REDUCED ABUNDANCE OF ADULT BANDED KOKOPU IN RIVERS THAT ARE TURBID DURING THE MIGRATION SEASON. ACHIEVING TURBIDITY LEVELS OF 125 NTU IN RIVERS AND STREAMS DURING THE MIGRATION SEASON WOULD THEREFORE HELP MAINTAIN UPSTREAM MIGRATIONS AND POPULATIONS OF BANDED KOKOPU, AND HENCE OTHER NATIVE FISH SPECIES.","BERG L, 1985, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V42, P1410, DOI 10.1139/F85-176; BOUBEE JAT, 1997, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V31, P61, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1997.9516745; BRUTON MN, 1985, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V125, P221, DOI 10.1007/BF00045937; CHIASSON AG, 1993, CAN J ZOOL, V71, P2419, DOI 10.1139/Z93-337; IMAN R.

HOWEVER, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LOSS OF DIADROMY AS AN INITIATOR FOR SPECIATION REMAINS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. THE RIVERS OF NEW ZEALAND'S SOUTH ISLAND HOUSE A SPECIES FLOCK OF RECENTLY DERIVED NONMIGRATORY GALAXIID FISHES KNOWN AS THE GALAXIAS VULGARIS COMPLEX. MEMBERS OF THIS COMPLEX ARE MORPHOLOGICALLY AND GENETICALLY SIMILAR TO THE DIADROMOUS G. BREVIPINNIS FOUND IN NEW ZEALAND AND SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA. WE HYPOTHESISED THAT SOUTH ISLAND'S G. VULGARIS COMPLEX (AT LEAST 10 NONMIGRATORY LINEAGES) REPRESENTS A NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT RADIATIONS FROM A MIGRATORY G. BREVIPINNIS STOCK, WITH REPEATED LOSS OF DIADROMY. SEQUENCE DATA WERE OBTAINED FOR 31 INGROUP SAMPLES (G. VULGARIS COMPLEX AND G. BREVIPINNIS) PLUS FOUR OUTGROUP TAXA. A WELL-RESOLVED PHYLOGENY BASED ON 5039 BASE PAIRS OF THE MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME SUGGESTS THAT DIADROMY HAS BEEN LOST ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS. THUS, SPECIATION IN THESE GALAXIID FISHES IS PARTLY AN INCIDENTAL PHENOMENON CAUSED BY SWITCHES FROM DIADROMOUS TO NONMIGRATORY STRATEGIES. HOWEVER, MUCH OF THE SUBSEQUENT NONMIGRATORY DIVERSITY IS MONOPHYLETIC, SUGGESTING THAT DRAINAGE EVOLUTION (VICARIANCE) HAS ALSO PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN CLADOGENESIS. LEVELS OF SEQUENCE DIVERGENCE AMONG MAJOR INGROUP LINEAGES (1.6-12.7%) SUGGEST THAT THE RADIATION IS CONSIDERABLY OLDER RELATIVE TO NORTHERN HEMISPHERE (POSTGLACIAL) COMPLEXES OF SALMONID, OSMERID, AND GASTEROSTEID FISHES. SYMPATRIC TAXA ARE NOT MONOPHYLETIC, SUGGESTING THAT THEIR COEXISTENCE REFLECTS SECONDARY CONTACT RATHER THAN SYMPATRIC SPECIATION. THE MONOPHYLY OF NEW ZEALAND G. BREVIPINNIS IS WELL SUPPORTED, BUT BOTH MITOCHONDRIAL DNA AND NUCLEAR SEQUENCES INDICATE THAT G. BREVIPINNIS IS PARAPHYLETIC ON AN INTERCONTINENTAL SCALE. THE DIVERGENCE (MAXIMUM 11.5%) BETWEEN TASMANIAN AND NEW ZEALAND G. BREVIPINNIS, ALTHOUGH LARGE, SUPPORTS MARINE DISPERSAL RATHER THAN VICARIANCE AS THE PRINCIPLE BIOGEOGRAPHIC MECHANISM ON AN INTERCONTINENTAL SCALE.","ALLIBONE, R.M., WALLIS, G.P., GENETIC VARIATION AND DIADROMY IN SOME NATIVE NEW ZEALAND GALAXIIDS (TELEOSTEI: GALAXIIDAE) (1993) BIOL.

248,SCOPUS,ARTICLE,2001,MCDOWALL RM,GETTING THE MEASURE OF FRESHWATER FISH HABITAT IN NEW ZEALAND,AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND MANAGEMENT,NA,"NEW ZEALAND HAS PROLIFIC, COOL, CLEAR FRESH WATER OF HIGH QUALITY, FOUND IN NUMEROUS MEDIUM TO SMALL RIVERS AND STREAMS AND LOW ELEVATION TO HIGH COUNTRY LAKES. THESE WATERWAYS CARRY A HIGHLY ENDEMIC FISH FAUNA OF LOW DIVERSITY (36 INDIGENOUS SPECIES, 21 EXOTIC SPECIES). THE INDIGENOUS FAUNA IS DOMINATED BY GALAXIIDAE (20 SPECIES), WHEREAS THE MOST DIVERSE EXOTIC GROUPS ARE SALMONIDAE AND CYPRINIDAE (7 SPECIES OF EACH). THE STEEP TOPOGRAPHY OF THE COUNTRY MEANS THAT THE RIVERS AND STREAMS TEND TO BE SWIFTLY FLOWING, WITH COARSE GRAVEL AND COBBLE, SUBSTRATES OF HARD ROCK, AND A HIGH PROPORTION OF THE INDIGENOUS SPECIES LIVE WITHIN THESE SUBSTRATES. ABOUT HALF THE INDIGENOUS SPECIES ARE DIADROMOUS, UNDERTAKING REGULAR, SEASONALLY-TIMED MIGRATIONS TO AND FROM THE SEA. FISHERIES BASED ON THE INDIGENOUS FAUNA INCLUDE MODEST COMMERCIAL ANGUILLID EEL AND GALAXIID WHITEBAIT FISHERIES, BUT PROBABLY THE CHIEF FORM OF FRESHWATER FISHERIES EXPLOITATION (IN OVERALL ECONOMIC TERMS) IS FOR NEW ZEALANDS WORLD-RENOWNED, RECREATIONAL ANGLING FISHERIES FOR SALMONIDS. RESEARCH ON THE FAUNA IS BROADLY SPREAD ACROSS DIVERSE FIELDS, FROM STUDIES OF THE PLACE OF FRESHWATER FISHES IN THE COMMUNITY ECOLOGY OF RIVER AND STREAM BIOTAS AS A WHOLE, TO FOCUSSED STUDIES ON HABITATS OF THREATENED SPECIES, DESIGN OF FISH PASSAGE FACILITIES FOR MIGRATORY FISHES, THE EFFECTS OF INTRODUCED EXOTIC SPECIES ON THE INDIGENOUS FAUNA, THE IMPACTS OF HUMAN STREAM PERTURBATION ON AQUATIC VALUES INCLUDING FISH, AND UNDERSTANDING THE LOCAL ECOLOGY OF SPECIES INTRODUCED TO NEW ZEALAND FROM OTHER LANDS. 2001, TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP, LLC.

IN CONTRAST, LARGER INDIVIDUALS ( GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 80 MM) WERE MOST COMMONLY OBSERVED IN DEEPER, SLOWER FLOWING POOLS. THESE PATTERNS OF HABITAT SELECTION ARE MOST LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRADE-OFFS INVOLVED WITH THE SELECTION OF OPTIMAL HABITATS FOR DRIFT FEEDING COMBINED WITH AVOIDANCE OF INTRA-SPECIFIC COMPETITION AND THE THREAT OF PREDATION FROM LARGER CONSPECIFICS.

A TOTAL OF EIGHT NATIVE AND TWO INTRODUCED SPECIES WERE RECORDED. EELS (ANGUILLA SPP.) AND GIANT KOKOPU (GALAXIAS ARGENTEUS GMELIN) WERE THE MOST WIDELY DISTRIBUTED SPECIES BEING LOCATED IN ALL STREAMS SURVEYED. COMMON BULLIES (GOBIOMORPHUS COTIDIANUS MCDOWALL) AND BROWN TROUT (SAHNO TRUTTA LINNAEUS) WERE ALSO WIDELY DISTRIBUTED BEING DETECTED IN SEVEN AND SIX OF THE STREAMS RESPECTIVELY. THREE STREAMS OF POTENTIAL CONSERVATION SIGNIFICANCE WERE IDENTIFIED. THESE WERE PICNIC GULLY CREEK WHICH CONTAINED A SIGNIFICANT POPULATION OF BANDED KOKOPU (GALAXIAS FASCIATUS GRAY), A CATEGORY C THREATENED SPECIES, AND CULLENS AND ALEX CREEKS WHICH CONTAINED SIGNIFICANT POPULATIONS OF GIANT KOKOPU, A CATEGORY B THREATENED SPECIES. THE POPULATION OF GIANT KOKOPU IN CULLENS AND ALEX CREEKS CURRENTLY REPRESENTS THE LARGEST KNOWN POPULATION OF THIS SPECIES ON THE EAST COAST OF NEW ZEALAND (EXCLUDING SOUTHLAND). IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT BROWN TROUT MAY INFLUENCE THE DISTRIBUTION OF NATIVE GALAXIIDS. THE LONGITUDINAL DISTRIBUTION OF GIANT KOKOPU AND BROWN TROUT IN STREAMS WAS EXAMINED AT NIGHT USING A CONTINUOUS SPOTLIGHT SAMPLING APPROACH.

IN THE PRESENCE OF A 2 CM S(-1) CURRENT FLOW, BANDED KOKOPU USE BOTH WATER CURRENT AND CHEMICAL INFORMATION TO LOCATE A FOOD ODOR SOURCE. THE SUPERFICIAL NEUROMASTS OF THE LATERAL LINE SYSTEM MEDIATE THE RHEOTACTIC COMPONENT OF THE ODOR SEARCH. A PHYSICAL BLOCK OF ONE OLFACTORY NOSTRIL DID NOT AFFECT THE OLFACTORY SEARCH STRATEGY EMPLOYED BY BANDED KOKOPU IN STILL WATER OR IN THE PRESENCE OF A CURRENT FLOW. THUS, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT BANDED KOKOPU PERFORM A BILATERAL COMPARISON OF THE OLFACTORY STIMULUS DURING THEIR ODOR SEARCH. PREVIOUSLY, OLFACTION AND GUSTATION HAVE BEEN THE ONLY SENSORY SYSTEMS SHOWN TO DIRECTLY MEDIATE ORIENTATION AND MOVEMENT TOWARDS ODOR SOURCES IN FISH. THE USE OF HYDRODYNAMIC CUES BY FISH IN LOCATION OF AN OLFACTORY SOURCE HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED, BUT WITHOUT DIRECT EXPERIMENTAL IDENTIFICATION OF THE SENSORY SYSTEMS EMPLOYED.

GIANT KOKOPU REMAINED WITHIN DEFINED STREAM REACHES DURING BASE FLOW CONDITIONS. DURING HIGH-DISCHARGE EVENTS, INDIVIDUALS EITHER STAYED WITHIN THEIR HOME REACH, MOVED AND SETTLED ELSEWHERE, OR MOVED AND RETURNED TO THEIR HOME REACH AS FLOWS SUBSIDED. THE VARIABLE BEHAVIOR EXHIBITED BY INDIVIDUAL GIANT KOKOPU SUGGESTED THAT REASONS FOR MOVING DURING FLOODS ARE COMPLEX. REASONS THAT MAY HAVE INFLUENCED MOVEMENT DURING FLOODS INCLUDED REPRODUCTION AND MATE SEARCHING, LACK OF ADEQUATE REFUGIA, OR SOME COMBINATION OF THESE. IN MANY INSTANCES, INDIVIDUAL GIANT KOKOPU APPEARED TO EXHIBIT ADAPTIVE BEHAVIORS IN RESPONSE TO HIGH DISCHARGES. BEHAVIORS SUPPORTING THIS VIEW INCLUDED FISH NOT MOVING DURING THE HIGHEST FLOODS, FISH MOVING UPSTREAM DURING THE PEAK DISCHARGE PERIOD, AND FISH MAKING PURPOSEFUL ``MICROMOVEMENTS'' (MOVEMENTS <5 M) INTO LOW-VELOCITY HABITATS. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT HIGH-DISCHARGE EVENTS MAY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ORGANIZING POPULATIONS OF FISH IN SMALL STREAMS BY PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS RESTRICTED DURING BASE FLOW CONDITIONS TO MOVE TO OTHER STREAM LOCATIONS.","ALLEN K.

ABUNDANCE (MEAN CPUE) IN FYKE NETS WAS LOWER ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE LAKE THAN ON THE WESTERN SIDE WHERE UNDERGROUND SPRINGS OCCURRED AND ROCKY SUBSTRATE PREDOMINATED. ADULTS WERE 54-135 MM LONG AND THE SEX RATIO VARIED WITH SIZE, WITH 68\% OF THE SMALLER FISH (60-70 MM) BEING MALE AND 79\% OF THE LARGER FISH (70-135 MM) BEING FEMALE. ALL FISH OVER 60 MM WERE SEXUALLY MATURE WITH 60\% HAVING EITHER WELL DEVELOPED OR RIPE GONADS BY SEPTEMBER. FEW FEMALES (12.5\%) HAD SPAWNED BY SEPTEMBER WHEREAS MOST (83\%) WERE SPENT BY APRIL, SO SPAWNING OCCURRED OVER SUMMER MONTHS. ABUNDANCE IN THE LAKE DROPPED BY OVER 70\% BETWEEN SEPTEMBER AND APRIL AND THIS SEASONAL DECLINE IS CONSISTENT WITH A SUMMER EMIGRATION OF MANY ADULT KOARO INTO INLET SPRINGS AND STREAMS TO SPAWN IN LAKE TRIBUTARIES DURING SUMMER AND AUTUMN. OVERALL, THE DIET OF LAKE-DWELLING KOARO WAS DOMINATED BY PURSE CADDIS LARVAE (PAROXYTHIRA SP.), BUT SMALL FISH (<70 MM) ALSO FED EXTENSIVELY ON DAPHNIA, WHEREAS LARGER ONES (>90 MM) FED ON ODONATA LARVAE, SNAILS, AND COMMON BULLIES. ALTHOUGH THE INTRODUCTION OF RAINBOW TROUT IN 1906 REDUCED THE KOARO POPULATION OF LAKE ROTOAIRA, THEY WERE STILL RELATIVELY ABUNDANT IN THE LAKE IN THE EARLY 1970S. HOWEVER, BY 1999, NO KOARO WERE FOUND IN THE SUBLITTORAL ZONE OF LAKE ROTOAIRA, AND TRAPPING IN THE LITTORAL REVEALED A RELATIVELY LOW ABUNDANCE RELATIVE TO OTHER COMPARABLE LAKES.

THEIR TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION, INTRALACUSTRINE MOVEMENTS (HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL), AND SPAWNING PERIODS WERE ANALYSED USING SEVERAL SAMPLING TECHNIQUES (ICHTHYOPLANKTON NET, SEINE NET, GILL NET, AND BAITED BENTHIC TRAPS). WE IDENTIFIED THE EARLY LIFE STAGES OF BOTH SPECIES BASED ON THEIR MORPHOLOGY AND OTOLITH SHAPE. THE FREE EMBRYOS OF BOTH SPECIES MIGRATE TO THE LIMNETIC ZONE, WHERE THEY COEXIST AS LARVAE, FACING THE SAME FOOD AVAILABILITY AND PROBABLY THE SAME PREDATION RISK. EACH SPECIES THEN MOVES ON TO ITS OWN JUVENILE AND ADULT HABITAT: THE LITTORAL AND BENTHIC ZONE FOR G. MACULATUS AND ONLY THE DEEPER BENTHIC ZONE FOR G. PLATEI.

A TOTAL OF 76 FOOD TAXA, PREDOMINANTLY INVERTEBRATES, WERE IDENTIFIED AND CATEGORISED AS EITHER OF AQUATIC OR TERRESTRIAL ORIGIN FROM THE 91 STOMACHS THAT CONTAINED FOOD ITEMS. AQUATIC TRICHOPTERA, GASTROPODA, AND HEMIPTERA COMPRISED 29.1, 12.6, AND 14.4\% BY ABUNDANCE RESPECTIVELY, AND TERRESTRIAL COLEOPTERA 12.2\% BY ABUNDANCE. ADULT TERRESTRIAL COLEOPTERA WERE THE MOST COMMONLY OCCURRING TAXA, AND WERE FOUND IN 59\% OF THE STOMACHS THAT CONTAINED FOOD. FOOD ITEMS OF AQUATIC ORIGIN OCCURRED IN 94.5\% OF THE GIANT KOKOPU STOMACHS THAT CONTAINED FOOD AND COMPRISED 74.9\% OF THE ITEMS BY ABUNDANCE. ALTHOUGH FEWER ITEMS OF TERRESTRIAL ORIGIN WERE ENCOUNTERED, THEY NEVERTHELESS APPEARED TO BE A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF THE DIET, AND OCCURRED IN 83.5\% OF THE GIANT KOKOPU STOMACHS THAT CONTAINED FOOD, AND COMPRISED 25.1\% OF THE ITEMS BY ABUNDANCE. ITEMS OF TERRESTRIAL ORIGIN OCCURRED SLIGHTLY MORE FREQUENTLY IN GIANT KOKOPU FROM LOTIC HABITATS THAN FROM LENTIC HABITATS. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF TERRESTRIAL FOOD MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH GIANT KOKOPU PREFERENCE FOR HABITATS WITH RIPARIAN COVER. FISH ALSO APPEARED TO BE A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF THE DIET, AS 26\% OF THE GIANT KOKOPU EXAMINED CONTAINED FISH REMAINS.

MAINTENANCE OF SUITABLE STREAM FLOWS FOR INANGA IS ONE MEANS OF PROTECTING THE FISHERY. OBSERVATIONS OF HABITAT USE BY DRIFT-FEEDING INANGA WERE MADE IN THREE STREAMS. MOST FEEDING INANGA WERE STATIONARY IN THE CURRENT TAKING FOOD ITEMS FROM THE DRIFT AND SOMETIMES FROM THE SURFACE. DRIFT-FEEDING LOCATIONS WERE RELATED TO CURRENT PATTERNS AND WATER VELOCITY, WITH INANGA FEEDING AT LOCATIONS WHERE THE CURRENT CONCENTRATED FOOD, AND WHERE WATER VELOCITIES WERE SUFFICIENTLY LOW TO ALLOW THE FISH TO HOLD POSITION. THE MEAN FEEDING VELOCITY DID NOT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN STREAMS, ALTHOUGH THE RANGE OF VELOCITIES USED DID. OPTIMUM FEEDING VELOCITIES WERE 0.03-0.07 M S(-1), AND WERE COMPARABLE WITH BROWN TROUT (SALMO TRUTTA) FEEDING VELOCITIES, WHEN ADJUSTED FOR THE DIFFERENCES IN FISH SIZE. DEPTH USE WAS VERY DIFFERENT BETWEEN STREAMS AND THIS WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE VARIATION IN AVAILABLE HABITAT. DEPTHS GREATER THAN 0.3 M WERE OPTIMUM, WITH SOME USE OF DEPTHS BETWEEN 0.1 AND 0.3 M. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT INANGA SUITABILITY CRITERIA ARE DICTATED BY BIOLOGICAL FACTORS, SUCH AS SWIMMING ABILITY AND BIO-ENERGETIC REQUIREMENTS, RATHER THAN THE RIVER THE FISH IS LIVING IN AND THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO COLLECT HABITAT USE AND AVAILABILITY DATA IN A WIDE RANGE OF STREAM TYPES TO DEFINE OPTIMAL HABITAT AND SUITABILITY CRITERIA FOR GENERALISED APPLICATION.","APT SYTS INC, 1991, GAUSS SYST VERS 2 1; BACHMAN RA, 1984, T AM FISH SOC, V113, P1, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(1984)113\&LT;1:FBOFWA\&GT;2.0.CO;2; BARTHOLOW J, 1990, J FISHERIES MANAGEME, V10, P362; BEECHER HAL A., 1995, RIVERS, V5, P109; BENZIE V, 1968, NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH, V2, P628; BOUBEE J.

THESE INDICATED THAT FIVE HABITAT FEATURES ARE IMPORTANT: IN-STREAM COVER, DEEP WATER, LOW WATER VELOCITY, PROXIMITY TO THE SEA, AND OVERHEAD SHADE/RIPARIAN COVER. THESE FEATURES WERE IMPORTANT IN TWO DISTINCT REGIONS SURVEYED AND FOR BOTH JUVENILE AND ADULT FISH. THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF RIPARIAN AND INSTREAM COVER WERE EXAMINED, BUT IT APPEARED THAT THE PRESENCE OF SOME FORM OF COVER WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ITS COMPOSITION.

THE ABUNDANCE OF ANGUILLA DIEFFENBACHII (GRAY) AND ANGUILLA AUSTRALIS (RICHARDSON) WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY LOGGING.

LOCATION THE FISH FAMILIES DISCUSSED ARE FOUND WIDELY IN SOUTHERN COOL TEMPERATE LANDS: IN AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, PATAGONIAN SOUTH AMERICA AND SOUTHERN AFRICA, AS WELL AS SOME OF THE SMALLER, REMOTE SOUTHERN OCEANIC ISLANDS. METHODS THE REVIEW IS BASED ON LITERATURE AND PRIMARILY EXAMINES THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS AND DIADROMOUS (SEA-MIGRATORY) LIFE HISTORIES. RESULTS THE BROAD DISTRIBUTION OF FRESHWATER FISHES OF THE LAMPREY FAMILIES GEOTRIIDAE AND MORDACIIDAE AND THE SALMONIFORM. GALAXIIDAE AND RETROPINNIDAE IN THE SOUTHERN COOL TEMPERATE ZONE, HAS CAUSED PROLONGED PERPLEXITY AND DEBATE. ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF BOTH A DISPERSAL BIOGEOGRAPHY AND A GONDWANA-BASED VICARIANCE BIOGEOGRAPHY HAVE BEEN PRESENTED. THESE ARE NOT NECESSARILY ALTERNATIVES. MAIN CONCLUSIONS EVIDENCE FROM: 1 DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS IN RELATION TO LIFE-HISTORY STRATEGIES; 2 GENETICS AND MORPHOLOGY; 3 DIFFERENT ELEMENTS IN THE NEW ZEALAND FAUNA AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS; 4 RECENT DISPERSAL EVENTS; 5 GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS AND THE RELATIONSHIPS OF ITS FRESHWATER FISHES; AND 6 PARASITOLOGY; ALL SUPPORT, OR ARE CONSISTENT WITH, A DISPERSAL BIOGEOGRAPHY OF THIS SOUTHERN COOL TEMPERATE FAUNA. THE GROUPS INVOLVED ARE SUFFICIENTLY ANCIENT TO HAVE FORMERLY INHABITED GONDWANA, BUT NO COMPELLING EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT PRESENT DISTRIBUTIONS REFLECT A FORMER BROAD GONDWANA-BASED RANGE.

THIS DEVELOPMENT DIVERTS SNOWY RIVER FLOW INTO TRIBUTARIES OF THE MURRAY RIVER VIA A SERIES OF EXTENSIVE TUNNELS. IN 1990, FISH SURVEYS OF THE UPPER MURRAY RIVER SYSTEM RECORDED GALAXIAS BREVIPINNIS, AN AGGRESSIVE MIGRATORY SPECIES PREVIOUSLY UNRECORDED FROM THE DRAINAGE. WE USED GENETIC ANALYSIS TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES FOR MURRAY RIVER G. BREVIPINNIS: (I) ANTHROPOGENIC TRANSLOCATION VIA THE SNOWY RIVER DIVERSION OR (II) A PREVIOUSLY UNDISCOVERED NATURAL POPULATION. LANDLOCKED G. BREVIPINNIS FROM THE MURRAY RIVER (43 FISH, EIGHT CONTROL REGION HAPLOTYPES) AND SNOWY RIVER (39 FISH, 11 HAPLOTYPES) EXHIBIT SIMILAR LEVELS OF MTDNA DIVERSITY, SHARE SIX HAPLOTYPES, AND ARE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENTIATED FOR MICROSATELLITE LOCI (P = 0.0884). COASTAL SAMPLES EXHIBIT HIGHER HAPLOTYPIC DIVERSITY (40 FISH, 20 HAPLOTYPES) BUT SHARE ONLY THREE HAPLOTYPES WITH MURRAY RIVER AND ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENTIATED FROM MURRAY RIVER SAMPLES FOR MICROSATELLITE LOCI (P = 0.0008). OUR DATA ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE TRANSLOCATION HYPOTHESIS BUT ARE GENERALLY INCONSISTENT WITH A NATURAL ORIGIN FOR MURRAY RIVER G. BREVIPINNIS.

THE RELATIONSHIP CONNECTS THE SWIMMING VELOCITY WITH FISH REYNOLDS AND FROUDE NUMBERS AND CAN BE USED IN BOTH ECOLOGICAL ANALYSIS (E.G. HABITAT REQUIREMENTS) AND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES (E.G. FISHWAYS DESIGN). CONTRARY TO SOME PREVIOUS STUDIES AND INTUITION, EFFECTS OF TURBULENCE ON SWIMMING PERFORMANCE APPEARED TO BE NEGLIGIBLE. THE MOST LIKELY EXPLANATION FOR THIS RESULT RELATES TO MECHANICS OF FISH-TURBULENCE INTERACTIONS THAT MAY BE DEPENDENT ON BOTH THE TURBULENCE SCALES AND ENERGY. THE DATA SUGGEST THAT FUTURE STUDIES OF TURBULENCE EFFECTS ON FISH BEHAVIOUR SHOULD INVOLVE, IN ADDITION TO TURBULENCE ENERGETICS, CONSIDERATION OF FISH DIMENSIONS IN RELATION TO THE SPECTRUM OF TURBULENCE SCALES.

SEASONAL VARIATION IN MICROHABITAT USE AND ACTIVITY OF 14 GIANT KOKOPU GALAXIAS ARGENTEUS, A DRIFT-FEEDING GALAXIID FISH, WAS COMPARED USING RADIOTELEMETRY. 2. DURING WINTER GIANT KOKOPU PREDOMINANTLY USED LOW VELOCITIES AND INTERMEDIATE DEPTHS BY NIGHT AND DAY. ACTIVITY RECORDED DURING 24 AND 72 H PERIODS INDICATED THAT FISH WERE CONSISTENTLY ACTIVE AT NIGHT AND INACTIVE DURING THE DAY. ACTIVITY DATA CORRESPONDED WITH POINT-IN-TIME HABITAT USE DATA, BOTH OF WHICH INDICATED THAT FISH WERE CONCEALED AMONGST COVER DURING THE DAY AND USED OPEN WATER HABITATS AT NIGHT. 3. DURING SUMMER, GIANT KOKOPU USED HIGHER WATER VELOCITIES, SHALLOWER DEPTHS AND COARSER SUBSTRATA, PARTICULARLY AT NIGHT BUT ALSO OCCASIONALLY DURING THE DAY RELATIVE TO WINTER. GIANT KOKOPU WERE ACTIVE BY BOTH DAY AND NIGHT IN SUMMER, ALTHOUGH PERIODS OF ACTIVITY WERE LESS DEFINED AND LESS PREDICTABLE THAN DURING WINTER. 4. ADULTS USED PREDICTABLE HOME REACHES AT BASE-FLOW, WITH MOST INDIVIDUALS REPEATEDLY USING OF ONE OR TWO COVER LOCATIONS WITHIN THEIR `HOME' REACH. REACHES USED BY FISH WERE RELATIVELY SHORT ( RARELY EXCEEDING 26 M) IRRESPECTIVE OF SEASON AND ALWAYS INCLUDED A SINGLE POOL-RIFFLE SEQUENCE. 5. DIEL AND SEASONAL BEHAVIOUR OF GIANT KOKOPU WAS GENERALLY COMPARABLE WITH THAT EXHIBITED BY OTHER DRIFT FEEDING FISH SPECIES IN SMALL TEMPERATE STREAMS. HOWEVER, THE NOCTURNAL ACTIVITY OF GIANT KOKOPU CONTRASTS WITH ACTIVITY PATTERNS IN VARIOUS SALMONIDS, INDICATING THAT THE IMPACT OF PREDATION BY DIFFERENT DRIFT FEEDING FISH MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY.","ALANARA A, 1997, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V54, P2894, DOI 10.1139/CJFAS-54-12-2894; ALANARA A, 2001, J ANIM ECOL, V70, P980, DOI 10.1046/J.0021-8790.2001.00550.X; BACHMAN RA, 1984, T AM FISH SOC, V113, P1, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(1984)113\&LT;1:FBOFWA\&GT;2.0.CO;2; BALTZ DM, 1991, T AM FISH SOC, V120, P166, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(1991)120<0166:SCIMSB>2.3.CO;2; BJORNN TC, 1971, T AM FISH SOC, V100, P423, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(1971)100<423:TASMIT>2.0.CO;2; BONNETT ML, 2002, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V36, P13, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2002.9517067; BRANNAS E, 1997, CAN J ZOOL, V75, P661, DOI 10.1139/Z97-086; BROWN RS, 1995, T AM FISH SOC, V124, P873, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0873:FAWMOA>2.3.CO;2; CLAPP DF, 1990, T AM FISH SOC, V119, P1022, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(1990)119<1022:RAAHOL>2.3.CO;2; CLOUGH S, 1998, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V372, P89; CONTOR CR, 1995, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V299, P179, DOI 10.1007/BF00767324; DAVID BO, 2003, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V37, P315, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2003.9517169; DAVID BO, 2002, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V36, P797, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2002.9517132; DAVID BO, 2002, T AM FISH SOC, V131, P762, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<0762:BOASDF>2.0.CO;2; DAVID BO, 2001, J FISH BIOL, V59, P705, DOI 10.1006/JFBI.2001.1684; DAVID BO, 2002, THESIS U OTAGO DUNED; FAUSCH KD, 1997, BEHAV ECOL, V8, P414, DOI 10.1093/BEHECO/8.4.414; FAUSCH KD, 1984, CAN J ZOOL, V62, P441, DOI 10.1139/Z84-067; FLECKER AS, 1994, ECOL APPL, V4, P798, DOI 10.2307/1942009; FRASER NHC, 1993, P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI, V252, P135, DOI 10.1098/RSPB.1993.0057; FRASER NHC, 1995, CAN J ZOOL, V73, P446, DOI 10.1139/Z95-051; GIROUX F, 2000, J FISH BIOL, V56, P1248, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8649.2000.TB02137.X; GREENBERG LA, 2001, ECOGRAPHY, V24, P212, DOI 10.1034/J.1600-0587.2001.240212.X; GROSSMAN GD, 1987, J ZOOL, V212, P151, DOI 10.1111/J.1469-7998.1987.TB05121.X; GROSSMAN GD, 2002, ECOL FRESHW FISH, V11, P2, DOI 10.1034/J.1600-0633.2002.110102.X; GROSSMAN GD, 1998, ECOL FRESHW FISH, V7, P108, DOI 10.1111/J.1600-0633.1998.TB00178.X; HEGGENES J, 1993, J ANIM ECOL, V62, P295, DOI 10.2307/5361; HISCOCK MJ, 2002, T AM FISH SOC, V131, P577, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<0577:WMORTJ>2.0.CO;2; HUGHES NF, 2000, ECOL FRESHW FISH, V9, P4, DOI 10.1034/J.1600-0633.2000.90102.X; HUGHES NF, 1994, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V51, P2154, DOI 10.1139/F94-216; HUGHES NF, 1998, ECOLOGY, V79, P281, DOI 10.1890/0012-9658(1998)0790281:AMOHSB2.0.CO;2; HURYN AD, 1998, OECOLOGIA, V115, P173, DOI 10.1007/S004420050505; KING CM, 1982, NEW ZEAL J ZOOL, V9, P49, DOI 10.1080/03014223.1982.10423837; LUCAS MC, 1996, J APPL ECOL, V33, P1345, DOI 10.2307/2404775; MATHENEY MP, 1995, T AM FISH SOC, V124, P886, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0886:POMAHU>2.3.CO;2; MCDOWALL R.

KOARO WERE 5-20 TIMES MORE ABUNDANT IN THE LARGE TURBID LAKES THAN IN THE CLEAR ONES, INDICATING THAT TURBIDITY MAY REDUCE THE EXTENT OF SALMONID PREDATION ON KOARO. HOWEVER, THE SCARCITY OF KOARO IN THE CLEAR LAKES WAS RELATED MAINLY TO THE PREVALENCE OF BROWN TROUT (SALMO TRUTTA) COMPARED WITH RAINBOW TROUT (ONCORHYNCHUS MYKISS) AS THE FORMER WERE MORE PISCIVOROUS AND HAD A STRONGER INVERSE RELATIONSHIP WITH KOARO. COMMON BULLIES WERE MORE ABUNDANT AT SITES 20 M OR MORE AWAY FROM THE SHORELINE, AND AT DEPTHS OF 9-12 M IRRESPECTIVE OF SEASON, YEAR AND TURBIDITY LEVEL. HOWEVER, THE OVERALL ABUNDANCE OF BULLIES WAS REDUCED BY 70-90\% IN THE TURBID LAKES. AS BULLIES ARE RELATIVELY INSENSITIVE TO THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF INCREASED TURBIDITY, INDIRECT EFFECTS SUCH AS REDUCTIONS IN MACROPHYTES FROM REDUCED WATER CLARITY OR SMOTHERING OF BENTHIC HABITATS BY SETTLED SOLIDS ARE THOUGHT TO INFLUENCE THEIR ABUNDANCE IN THE LAKES AFFECTED BY GLACIAL TURBIDITY. THERE WAS NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EXTENT OF WATER-LEVEL FLUCTUATION AND THE ABUNDANCE OF KOARO OR COMMON BULLIES IN THE LAKES, BUT THE DEPTH DISTRIBUTION OF BULLIES WAS SHALLOWEST IN THE LAKE WITH THE LEAST WATER-LEVEL FLUCTUATION AND WAS DEEPEST IN THE LAKE WITH THE GREATEST WATER-LEVEL FLUCTUATION.","ARMSTRONG JS, 1935, T P ROYAL SOC NZ, V65, P88; BARRETT JC, 1992, T AM FISH SOC, V121, P437, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(1992)121<0437:TICIRD>2.3.CO;2; BORGSTROM R, 1973, NORWEGIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY, V21, P101; BOUBEE JAT, 1997, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V31, P61, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1997.9516745; BUCK P, 1921, T P NZ I, V53, P433; CLAYTON J, 1986, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V20, P185, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1986.9516142; CROWL T.A., 1992, REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES, V2, P217, DOI 10.1007/BF00045038; FAGO DON, 1998, NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT, V18, P731, DOI 10.1577/1548-8675(1998)018<0731:COLFAS>2.0.CO;2; FLETCHER HJ, 1919, T NZ I, V51, P259; FLETCHER HJ, 1919, NZ J SCI TECHNOLOGY, V2, P367; FORSYTH DJ, 1988, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V22, P327, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1988.9516305; GAGE D, 1975, NZ LAKES; GRAYNOTH E, 1986, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V20, P537, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1986.9516174; HAWES I, 1996, FRESHWATER BIOL, V36, P297, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-2427.1996.T01-1-00089.X; HAYES JW, 1987, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V44, P40, DOI 10.1139/F87-005; HOWARDWILLIAMS C, 1995, FRESHWATER BIOL, V33, P91, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2427.1995.TB00389.X; IRWIN J, 1972, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V6, P482; JAMES GD, 2002, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V36, P39, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2002.9517069; JAMES GD, 1998, CHC9835 NIWA; JAMES MR, 1998, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V32, P287, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1998.9516826; JAMES MR, 2000, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V441, P93, DOI 10.1023/A:1017504820168; JAMES MR, 1995, ELE906 NIWA; JOHNSON WS, 1976, 144 NZ MIN AGR FISH; MCCARTER NH, 1987, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V20, P55; MCDOWALL RM, 1994, J ROY SOC NEW ZEAL, V24, P161, DOI 10.1080/03014223.1994.9517462; MCDOWALL RM, 1990, NZ FRESHWATER FISHES; MEREDYTHYOUNG JL, 1977, 150 NZ MIN AGR FISH; NAYLOR JR, 1983, THESIS U CANTERBURY; PHILLIPPS W.

SAMPLES OF G. BREVIPINNIS COLLECTED FROM THREE NEW ZEALAND LAKES (WAKATIPU, WANAKA, AND OKAREKA) WERE EXAMINED USING MICROSATELLITE DNA ANALYSIS TO LOOK FOR EVIDENCE OF GENETIC STRUCTURING AMONG SAMPLES WITHIN LAKES (POSSIBLY INDICATIVE OF INCIPIENT SYMPATRIC SPECIATION OR NATAL STREAM LOYALTY). COMPARISON AMONG LAKES WAS MADE TO PROVIDE A CONTEXT FOR GENETIC STRUCTURING WITHIN LAKES. THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION AMONG LAKE POPULATIONS, REFLECTING ORIGINAL FOUNDER EFFECT AND SUBSEQUENT GENETIC DRIFT. HOWEVER, THERE WAS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF RESTRICTED GENE FLOW AMONG SAMPLES FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF LAKES AND THEIR TRIBUTARIES. NAMELY, THERE IS NO GENETIC EVIDENCE OF INCIPIENT SPECIATION IN LAKE OKAREKA, AND LITTLE OR NO EVIDENCE OF STREAM LOYALTY IN LAKE WAKATIPU.

THREE GROUPS OF STREAMS, EACH DIFFERING IN THE RELATIVE AMOUNT OF THREE TYPES OF IN-STREAM COVER (I.E., WOOD, BOULDERS, UNDERCUT BANKS) WERE SELECTED AND BANDED KOKOPU WERE SAMPLED IN THEIR POOLS USING ELECTRIC FISHING. BANDED KOKOPU OCCURRED BENEATH BOULDERS, UNDERCUT BANKS, AND WOOD MATERIAL IN ALL POOLS EXCEPT THOSE LACKING ANY IN-STREAM COVER, OR THOSE WHERE LARGE (TOTAL LENGTH >400 MM) EELS WERE PRESENT. THEIR PRESENCE IN POOLS WAS THEREFORE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON IN-STREAM COVER, PROVIDED LARGE EELS WERE ABSENT. IN STREAMS WHERE THE COVER PROVIDED BY BOULDERS WAS LACKING, BANDED KOKOPU SELECTED MAINLY UNDERCUT BANKS AND WOOD. HOWEVER, IN STREAMS CONTAINING LARGE AMOUNTS OF BANK AND BOULDER COVER, WOOD WAS UNDER-UTILISED, INDICATING THAT IT WAS LEAST PREFERRED. IN POOLS PROVIDING A CHOICE OF COVER TYPES, BANK COVER WAS MORE FREQUENTLY USE THAN OTHER TYPES, INDICATING THAT IT IS PREFERRED. THE MEAN SIZE OF BANDED KOKOPU IN POOLS WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THEIR RELATIVE ABUNDANCE, AND THEIR ABUNDANCE WAS IN TURN RELATED TO HABITAT QUALITY AS DEFINED BY IN-STREAM COVER. STREAMS WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT OF BANK COVER HAD THE LOWEST NUMBER OF POOLS OCCUPIED BY BANDED KOKOPU, FEWER BANDED KOKOPU PER POOL, FEWER POOLS CONTAINING TWO OR MORE BANDED KOKOPU, AND THE SMALLEST BANDED KOKOPU. COLLECTIVELY, THESE DATA INDICATE THAT BANK COVER IN POOLS PROVIDES OPTIMAL HABITAT FOR BANDED KOKOPU, AND THAT WOOD MATERIAL WAS IMPORTANT ONLY WHERE OTHER TYPES OF MORE PERMANENT COVER WERE LACKING. LOGS AND WOOD SLASH FROM LOGGING OPERATIONS COULD THEREFORE BE IMPORTANT FOR INCREASING BANDED KOKOPU HABITAT IN LOGGED STREAMS WHERE BANK AND BOULDER COVER ARE SCARCE.","CARTON G, 2001, WATER ATMOSPHERE, V9, P18; CHADDERTON WL, 2000, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V34, P487, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2000.9516951; GRENOUILLET G, 2000, ARCH HYDROBIOL, V149, P307; HANCHET SM, 1990, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V24, P159, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1990.9516411; HARDING JS, 1995, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V29, P479, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1995.9516681; HOPKINS CL, 1979, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V13, P225, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1979.9515797; HOPKINS CL, 1979, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V13, P39, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1979.9515779; JOWETT IG, 1996, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V30, P463, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1996.9516735; KOEHN JD, 1994, AUST J MAR FRESH RES, V45, P1353; MAIN MR, 1988, VERHANDLUNGEN INT VE, V23, P1785; MITCHELL CP, 1982, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V16, P131, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1982.9515955; QUINN JM, 1997, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V31, P665, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1997.9516797; RICHARDSON J, 2001, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V35, P191, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2001.9516989; ROWE D, 2000, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V34, P545; ROWE DK, 1999, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V33, P141, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1999.9516864",10.1080/00288330.2003.9517188,10,NEW ZEALAND;NEW ZEALAND,237,CRI,NIWA,NZ,WAIKATO,N,N,N,N,Y,N,REGIONAL,20,N,NA,NA,Y,N,N,N,N,N,NA,NA,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,Y,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N

158,WOS,ARTICLE,2003,MCDOWALL RM,"VARIATION IN VERTEBRAL NUMBER IN GALAXIID FISHES (TELEOSTEI : GALAXIIDAE): A LEGACY OF LIFE HISTORY, LATITUDE AND LENGTH",ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,MERISTIC VARIATION; DIADROMY; TEMPERATURE; SIZE,"MEAN VERTEBRAL COUNTS AMONG SPECIES OF GALAXIIDAE VARY CURVILINEARLY WITH FISH SIZE - LARGE SPECIES HAVE MORE VERTEBRAE (PLEOMERISM). THE RELATIONSHIP WITH SIZE BREAKS DOWN AMONG ADULTS OF DIADROMOUS SPECIES. THERE IS MOSTLY NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VERTEBRAL COUNT AND BODY SHAPE, ALTHOUGH AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COUNT AND BODY DEPTH IN A SERIES OF DIVERGENT SMALL GALAXIIDS MAY REFLECT A SHIFT IN SWIMMING MODE. DIADROMOUS POPULATIONS HAVE MORE VERTEBRAE THAN NON-DIADROMOUS ( LANDLOCKED) CONSPECIFICS ( AROUND THE SAME NUMBER AS RELATED NON-DIADROMOUS SPECIES). DIADROMOUS SPECIES HAVE MORE VERTEBRAE THAN RELATED NON-DIADROMOUS SPECIES AND EXHIBIT RISING VERTEBRAL NUMBER WITH INCREASING LATITUDE ( JORDAN'S RULE APPLIES). REGRESSIONS OF VERTEBRAL NUMBER AGAINST LATITUDE DIFFER AMONG CONSPECIFIC POPULATIONS FROM DIFFERENT REGIONS, PERHAPS REFLECTING DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LATITUDE AND LOCAL CLIMATE. DIFFERENCES IN COUNTS BETWEEN DIADROMOUS AND NON-DIADROMOUS SPECIES ARE NOT SIMPLY A DIRECT INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT ON ONTOGENY, AS EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIES/POPULATIONS UNDERTAKING THE TWO DISTINCT LIFE HISTORY STRATEGIES OCCURS IN SIMILAR, FRESHWATER HABITATS; DIFFERENCES SEEM LIKELY TO BE EVOLVED, AND TO REFLECT AN ADVANTAGE OF HIGHER VERTEBRAL COUNTS IN MARINE ENVIRONMENTS, WHERE DIADROMOUS SPECIES LIVE AS JUVENILES. THIS CONCLUSION IS SUPPORTED BY CORRELATION BETWEEN VERTEBRAL COUNTS AND SIZE OF JUVENILES OF DIADROMOUS SPECIES AT RETURN FROM THE SEA, SUGGESTING SELECTION FOR VERTEBRAL NUMBER DURING MARINE LIFE. OVERALL, VERTEBRAL COUNT IS THUS INFLUENCED BY A COMPLEX AMALGAM OF FISH SIZE, LIFE HISTORY, AND ENVIRONMENT. THE EXPLANATION FOR PLEOMERISM MAY WELL BE RELATED TO THE SCALING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LENGTH AND CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA ( AREA RISES BY THE SQUARE OF LENGTH INCREASE) LEADING TO INCREASING STIFFNESS WITH GROWTH - COMPENSATED FOR IN LARGER SPECIES BY HAVING MORE VERTEBRAE. THIS COULD ALSO BE DRIVEN BY SCALING IN THE SURFACE AREA OF THE ARTICULAR FACETS OF THE VERTEBRAE THEMSELVES.","ALLIBONE RM, 1996, BIOL J LINN SOC, V57, P107, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8312.1996.TB01832.X; ARMSTRONG R.

ITS LARGE GEOGRAPHIC SEPARATION FROM POPULATIONS IN SOUTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA, AND SUBSEQUENT REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION AND VARIATION IN THE PREVAILING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, HAS CREATED MARKED DIFFERENCES IN BIOLOGY (AND MORPHOLOGY) BETWEEN THE EASTERN AND WESTERN POPULATIONS OF G. TRUTTACEUS. THE BIOLOGY (SPAWNING PERIOD, LONGEVITY, GROWTH RATES, DIET AND PARASITISM) OF G. TRUTTACEUS IN THE GOODGA RIVER IS DESCRIBED AND THEN COMPARED WITH INFORMATION ON THE BIOLOGY OF DIADROMOUS AND LANDLOCKED POPULATIONS IN SOUTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA (I.E. TASMANIA) (SEE HUMPHRIES 1989). IN THE GOODGA RIVER, CA. 34 AND 8\% OF MALES AND FEMALES, RESPECTIVELY, ATTAIN MATURITY AT THE END OF THEIR FIRST YEAR, WHILE ONLY FOUR MATURE MALES AND ONE MATURE FEMALE 0+ FISH WERE FOUND IN THE TASMANIAN POPULATIONS. ADULTS MIGRATE UPSTREAM PRIOR TO SPAWNING WHICH PEAKS DURING APRIL AND MAY. LARVAE, WHICH HATCH AT CA. 6.5 MM (CF. 7.5-9.0 MM IN TASMANIA), MOVE DOWNSTREAM INTO MOATES LAKE FOR A FEW MONTHS BEFORE RE-ENTERING THE RIVER. OF THE 810 G. TRUTTACEUS COLLECTED, CA. 53, 34, 10, 2, 1, 0.2 AND 0.1\% BELONGED TO THE 0+, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+, 5+ AND 7+ AGE CLASSES, RESPECTIVELY. IN CONTRAST, THE TASMANIAN POPULATIONS HAVE A MUCH HIGHER PROPORTION OF OLDER FISH. AT THE END OF THEIR FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD YEARS, THE MALES ON AVERAGE ATTAIN 60, 84 AND 95 MM TOTAL LENGTH (TL), RESPECTIVELY, WHEREAS FEMALES ATTAIN 63, 89 AND 103 MM TL, RESPECTIVELY AT THOSE AGES. ONLY ONE FISH > 140 MM TL WAS CAPTURED, WHICH CONTRASTS WITH THE TASMANIAN FISH, WHERE A SUBSTANTIAL PROPORTION ARE > 140 MM TL. THE DIET OF FISH > 40 MM TL CONSISTED OF BETWEEN 65 AND 96\% TERRESTRIAL FAUNA (MAINLY COLEOPTERANS AND HYMENOPTERANS) IN THE DIFFERENT SEASONS. LARVAL FISH DIETS WERE LARGELY COMPRISED OF COPEPODS. THE OCCURRENCE OF THE INTRODUCED CESTODE LIGULA INTESTINALIS IN CA. 7\% OF G. TRUTTACEUS REPRESENTS THE FIRST RECORD OF THIS PARASITE INWESTERN AUSTRALIA. IT WAS FOUND TO CAUSE GONADAL RETARDATION AND GROSS MORPHOLOGICAL DEFORMITIES, THE LATTER OF WHICH POSSIBLY INCREASES THE RISK OF AVIAN PREDATION.","ALLEN G.R., 1989, FRESHWATER FISHES AU; ALLEN G.R., 1982, FIELD GUIDE INLAND F; AULT TR, 1994, T AM FISH SOC, V123, P939, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(1994)123<0939:EOHSAT>2.3.CO;2; CADWALLADER P., 1982, B AUSTR SOC LIMNOLOG, V8, P17; CHUBB JC, 1987, J FISH BIOL, V31, P517, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8649.1987.TB05256.X; COOPER A.

244,SCOPUS,ARTICLE,2003,MCDOWALL RM,"VARIATION IN VERTEBRAL NUMBER IN GALAXIID FISHES, HOW FISHES SWIM AND A POSSIBLE REASON FOR PLEOMERISM",REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES,GALAXIIDAE;  PLEOMERISM;  SWIMMING MODE;  VARIATION;  VERTEBRAL COUNT,"THE NUMBER OF VERTEBRAE IN FISHES IS WIDELY VARIABLE, WITH THIS VARIATION HAVING CONNECTIONS TO PHYLETIC POSITION, GEOGRAPHY, VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS SUCH AS TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY, BIOME OCCUPIED AND LIFE HISTORY PATTERN. VARIATION IS SOMETIMES A RESPONSE TO ENVIRONMENT, SOMETIMES EXPLICITLY ADAPTIVE AND PROBABLY OFTEN BOTH. SWIMMING MODE IS LIKELY TO BE INFLUENCED BY BODY FLEXIBILITY, WHICH IN TURN IS INFLUENCED BY VERTEBRAL COUNTS. SINCE VERTEBRAL NUMBER IS FIXED EARLY IN ONTOGENY, THERE IS A PREDICTIVE ELEMENT IN THE 'CHOICE' OF VERTEBRAL NUMBER DURING DEVELOPMENT THAT AFFECTS LATER ADAPTIVENESS. PLEOMERISM, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VERTEBRAL NUMBER AND BODY SIZE ACROSS THE DIVERSITY OF FISHES, MAY BE DRIVEN BY THE SQUAR/CUBE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LENGTH, CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA AND VOLUME. PLEOMERISM IN DIADROMOUS GALAXIID FISHES PROBABLY REFLECTS ADAPTIVE ADVANTAGES ACHIEVED DURING MARINE JUVENILE LIFE AND IN NON-DIADROMOUS SPECIES MAY REFLECT THE SIZE AT WHICH MID-WATER, SHOALING JUVENILES BECOME TO BENTHIC, CRYPTIC, WITHIN-SUBSTRATE BEHAVIOURS. 2004 KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS.","BEEMAN, J.W., RONDORF, D.W., TILSON, M.E., ASSESSING SMOLTIFICATION OF JUVENILE SPRING CHINOOK SALMON (ONCORHYNCHUS TSHAWYTSCHA) USING CHANGES IN BODY MORPHOLOGY (1994) CAN.

THE EVIDENCE IS LARGELY CIRCUMSTANTIAL, HOWEVER, AND HABITAT DETERIORATION MAY ALSO HAVE PLAYED A ROLE. NOR IS PREDATION THE ONLY MEANS BY WHICH INTRODUCED TROUT MIGHT BE HAVING A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON NATIVE FISH. STUDIES OF TROUT POPULATION STREAM ECOLOGY SHOW THAT TROUT MAY CONSUME THE ENTIRE ANNUAL BENTHIC INSECT PRODUCTION OF STREAMS, LEADING TO A TROPHIC CASCADE THAT IS EVIDENT IN THE PROLIFERATION OF PERIPHYTON IN THE RELATIVE ABSENCE OF INVERTEBRATE GRAZING. CHANGES IN THE BEHAVIOR OF BOTH BENTHIC INVERTEBRATES AND NATIVE FISH ARE ALSO BELIEVED TO HAVE RESULTED FROM TROUT PREDATION. THE OBSERVED LEVEL OF BENTHOS PREDATION SUGGESTS THAT AN ADDITIONAL IMPACT OF TROUT ON NATIVE FISH MAY FUNCTION THROUGH A FEEDBACK LOOP: NATIVE FISH MAY BE LESS ABLE TO OBTAIN FOOD OWING TO CHANGES IN THEIR OWN BEHAVIOR, INSECT BEHAVIOR, AND INSECT ABUNDANCE, ALL OF WHICH ARE INDUCED BY TROUT PREDATION. 2003 TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP, LLC.","ALLEN, K.R., THE HOROKIWI STREAM: A STUDY OF A TROUT POPULATION (1951) NEW ZEALAND MARINE DEPARTMENT FISHERIES BULLETIN, 10, PP. 1-238; ALLIBONE, R.M., IMPOUNDMENT AND INTRODUCTIONS: THEIR IMPACTS ON NATIVE FISH OF THE UPPER WAIPORI RIVER, NEW ZEALAND (1999) JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND, 29, PP. 291-299; ALLIBONE, R.M., CROWL, T.A., HOLMES, J.M., KING, T.M., MCDOWALL, R.M., TOWNSEND, C.R., WALLIS, G.P., ISOZYME ANALYSIS OF GALAXIAS SPECIES (TELEOSTEI: GALAXIIDAE) FROM THE TAIERI RIVER, SOUTH ISLAND, NEW ZEALAND: A SPECIES COMPLEX REVEALED (1996) BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY, 57, PP. 107-127; ALLIBONE, R.M., MCDOWALL, R.M., CONSERVATION ECOLOGY OF THE DUSKY GALAXIAS, GALAXIASPUL-LUS (TELEOSTEI: GALAXIIDAE) (1997) SCIENCE FOR CONSERVATION, 6, PP. 1-48; ALLIBONE, R.M., MCINTOSH, A.R., (1999) NATIVE FISH SPORT FISH INTERACTIONS: A REVIEW.

A STREAM SIMULATOR WAS USED TO TEST THE EFFECTS OF JUVENILE BROWN TROUT (SALMO TRUTTA) (FORK LENGTH RANGE 66-115 MM) ON HABITAT USE OF INANGA (GALAXIAS MACULATUS) (FORK LENGTH RANGE 51-100 MM) DURING AUTUMN. THE STREAM SIMULATOR CONSISTED OF A SINGLE RUN-RIFFLE-POOL SEQUENCE LINED WITH GRAVEL AND COBBLE SUBSTRATES, AND C. 8 M(3) OF UNTREATED ARTESIAN WATER WAS RECIRCULATED THROUGH THE STREAM SIMULATOR AT A RATE OF 3 LITRES S(-1). STREAM INVERTEBRATES WERE INTRODUCED INTO THE STREAM SIMULATOR TO PROVIDE FOOD FOR THE FISH. FOUR EXPERIMENTS WERE RUN, EACH CONSISTING OF THREE 1-DAY TRIALS USING EITHER 10 INANGA, 20 INANGA, OR 10 INANGA AND BROWN TROUT. COUNTS OF INANGA VISIBLE IN EACH OF 12 DESIGNATED HABITAT ZONES WERE MADE THROUGHOUT THE DAY, AND PROPORTIONS OF VISIBLE INANGA WERE USED IN REPEATED MEASURE ANOVAS TO TEST WHETHER THE PROPORTION OF FISH VISIBLE VARIED ACCORDING TO THE TIME OF DAY, THE DENSITY OF INANGA, OR THE PRESENCE OF TROUT. OUR EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT NEITHER THE PRESENCE OF JUVENILE BROWN TROUT NOR THE DENSITY OF INANGA HAD SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON INANGA HABITAT USE IN THE STREAM SIMULATOR. WE CONCLUDE THAT IN NEW ZEALAND STREAMS ANY INFLUENCE OF BROWN TROUT ON INANGA IS MORE LIKELY TO RESULT FROM PREDATION AND/OR COMPETITION FOR FOOD BY LARGER BROWN TROUT.","ALLEN K.

RESULTS SUGGEST THAT GIANT KOKOPU FEED ACTIVELY DURING NIGHT AND DAY IN SUMMER, AND THAT PREY SELECTION IS INFLUENCED BY INTERACTIONS BETWEEN FACTORS INCLUDING PREY AVAILABILITY, PREY CHARACTERISTICS AND LIGHT.","ALANARA A, 2001, J ANIM ECOL, V70, P980, DOI 10.1046/J.0021-8790.2001.00550.X; BONNETT ML, 2002, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V36, P361, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2002.9517093; CADWALLADER P L, 1975, NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH, V9, P11; CLOSS GP, 1994, AUST J MAR FRESH RES, V45, P227; DAVID BO, 2003, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V37, P315, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2003.9517169; DAVID BO, 2003, FRESHWATER BIOL, V48, P1765, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-2427.2003.01127.X; DAVID BO, 2002, THESIS U OTAGO DUNED; FAUSCH KD, 1984, CAN J ZOOL, V62, P441, DOI 10.1139/Z84-067; GILES N, 1980, J FISH BIOL, V16, P441, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8649.1980.TB03722.X; GLOVA GJ, 1991, AUST J MAR FRESH RES, V42, P423; GROSSMAN GD, 2002, ECOL FRESHW FISH, V11, P2, DOI 10.1034/J.1600-0633.2002.110102.X; HAYES JW, 1996, J ROY SOC NEW ZEAL, V26, P139, DOI 10.1080/03014223.1996.9517508; JELLYMAN D J, 1979, MAURI ORA, V7, P53; MCDOWALL RM, 1997, ECOL FRESHW FISH, V6, P217, DOI 10.1111/J.1600-0633.1997.TB00164.X; MCDOWALL RM, 1996, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V30, P257; MCDOWALL RM, 1990, NZ FRESHWATER FISHES; MEYER-ROCHOW VB, 2003, FISH ADAPTATIONS, P337; MITTLEBACH G.

LOCATION LAKES AND RIVERS OF PATAGONIA. METHODS WE COMPARED, AND EVENTUALLY RECONSIDERED, GENERAL DATA ABOUT DISTRIBUTION BASED ON THE ORIGINAL LITERATURE ABOUT CAPTURE SITES, INCORPORATING SEVERAL PUBLISHED AND UNPUBLISHED DATA TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE BIOLOGICAL TRAITS AND DISTRIBUTION OF GALAXIIDAE. RESULTS THE MORE CONSISTENT ISSUE IN THE COMPREHENSION OF GALAXIID BIOGEOGRAPHY IN SOUTH AMERICA IS THE ABILITY TO ESTABLISH LANDLOCKED POPULATIONS. DIFFERENT FOUNDING EVENTS IN LANDLOCKED POPULATIONS OF GALAXIAS MACULATUS SUGGEST THE POSSIBLE EXISTENCE OF OLDER AND YOUNGER LANDLOCKED POPULATIONS. THIS DIFFERENCE IN THE TIME SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LACUSTRINE POPULATIONS COULD HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED IN THEIR ABILITY FOR COLONIZATION OF POST-GLACIAL AREAS. GALAXIAS MACULATUS, APLOCHITON AND BRACHYGALAXIAS ARE MORE CLEARLY EXCLUDED FROM THE POST-GLACIAL AREA THAN G. PLATEI. FOR ALL THE SPECIES WE COULD NOTE A MORE ABUNDANT RECORD OF LAKE POPULATIONS AT THE AREA OF GLACIAL REFUGES. IT COULD BE NOTED THAT THE MOST SUCCESSFUL SPECIES, GALAXIAS PLATEI, IS A SPECIALIZED DEEP BOTTOM DWELLER. DEEP BOTTOM DWELLING HELPS TO ENDURE WINTER CONSTRAINTS AND IT APPEARS TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE COLONIZATION OF THE LITTORAL AND LIMNETIC ZONES OF POST-GLACIAL LAKES, THE PREFERED HABITAT OF THE OTHER PATAGONIAN FISH SPECIES. MAIN CONCLUSIONS AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS OF POST-GLACIAL COLONIZATION, IN THE BEGINNING OF TWENTIETH CENTURY, MAN INTRODUCED SEVERAL SALMONID SPECIES IN PATAGONIA. IN ADDITION, ANTROPOGENIC ACTIONS HAD ITS MORE RECENT CONSEQUENCES IN GLOBAL WARMING. NOWADAYS WE WERE ABLE TO OBSERVE NEW LOCALITIES FOR BRAZILIAN FISHES INTO THE AUSTRAL SUBREGION AND EXPECT SOME CHANGES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF GALAXIIDAE. NORTHERN LIMITS FOR ALL SPECIES AND SOUTHERN LIMITS FOR LANDLOCKED G. MACULATUS, BRACHIGALAXIAS BULLOCKI AND APLOCHITON ZEBRA, COULD BE DISPLACED SOUTHWARD. PROBABLY, THE SPECIES LESS AFFECTED BY THE CHANGES WILL BE G. PLATEI. THESE PREDICTIONS COULD BE ACCURATELY FORMULATED USING THE MODEL OF B.J. SHUTER \& J.R.

PREVALENCE AND MEAN INTENSITY ARE HIGHER IN SMALLER FISHES THAN IN LARGER ONES. A SEASONAL PATTERN WAS OBSERVED, WITH PEAK RECRUITMENT AND PEAK MEAN INTENSITY OCCURRING IN EARLY SPRING (SEPTEMBER), FOLLOWED BY LOWS IN LATE SUMMER (JANUARY-FEBRUARY). GALAXIAS MACULATUS LENGTH CLASSES ARE SPATIALLY SEGREGATED DUE TO SEASONAL MIGRATIONS, SO THE ANNUAL INFECTION CYCLE IS CHARACTERIZED BY HIGHER PREVALENCE AND INTENSITY FROM LATE WINTER TO EARLY SUMMER IN THE SMALLER FISH FROM THE DEEP ZONE OF THE LAKE.","ANSHARY H, 2001, FISH PATHOL, V36, P27, DOI 10.3147/JSFP.36.27; APPLEBY C, 1996, J FISH BIOL, V48, P1266, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8649.1996.TB01820.X; APPLEBY C, 1997, J PARASITOL, V83, P23, DOI 10.2307/3284312; APPLEBY C, 1996, THESIS NORWEGIAN COL; BARKER DE, 2000, AQUACULTURE, V187, P261, DOI 10.1016/S0044-8486(00)00324-0; BARRIGA JP, 2002, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V36, P345, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2002.9517092; BERRA TM, 1996, MAR FRESHWATER RES, V47, P845, DOI 10.1071/MF9960845; BUCHER F, 1993, J FISH BIOL, V42, P403; BUCHMANN K, 2002, INT J PARASITOL, V32, P309, DOI 10.1016/S0020-7519(01)00332-0; BUSH AO, 1997, J PARASITOL, V83, P575, DOI 10.2307/3284227; CECCHINI S, 2001, FISH PATHOL, V36, P33, DOI 10.3147/JSFP.36.33; CERVELLINI PM, 1993, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V36, P283, DOI 10.1007/BF00001724; CHUBB J.C., 1977, ADVANCES IN PARASITOLOGY, V15, P133, DOI 10.1016/S0065-308X(08)60528-X; CLOUTMAN DG, 1978, J PARASITOL, V64, P170, DOI 10.2307/3279641; CONE D.

BREVIPINNIS). BANDED KOKOPU OCCURRENCE WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH SMALL STREAMS AND LOW-INTENSITY LAND USES (E.G., SHEEP GRAZING OR FORESTED), WHEREAS INTENSIVE LAND USES (E.G., MIXED SHEEP AND CATTLE FARMING) AND LACK OF RIPARIAN FOREST COVER IMPACTED NEGATIVELY ON OCCURRENCE AT SAMPLED SITES. ALSO, IF FORESTS WERE POSITIONED PREDOMINANTLY IN LOWLAND AREAS, BANDED KOKOPU OCCURRENCE DECLINED WITH INCREASING DISTANCE TO STREAM MOUTH. KOARO OCCURRENCE WAS POSITIVELY INFLUENCED BY CATCHMENT FOREST COVER, HIGH STREAM ALTITUDES, AND AREAS OF NO FARMING ACTIVITY OR MIXED LAND USES. INTENSIVE LAND USES, DISTANCE TO STREAM MOUTH, AND PRESENCE OF BANDED KOKOPU NEGATIVELY INFLUENCED KOARO OCCUPANCY OF STREAM REACHES. BANDED KOKOPU AND KOARO PRESENCE WAS PREDICTED IN 86.0\% AND 83.7\% AGREEMENT, RESPECTIVELY, WITH FIELD OBSERVATIONS. WE USED THE MODELS TO QUANTIFY THE AMOUNT OF STREAM REACHES THAT WOULD BE OF GOOD, MODERATE, AND POOR QUALITY, BASED ON THE PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCES OF THE FISH BEING GREATER THAN 0.75, BETWEEN 0.75 AND 0.5, OR LESS THAN 0.5, RESPECTIVELY. HINDCASTING USING HISTORICAL DATA ON VEGETATION COVER UNDERTAKEN FOR ONE CATCHMENT, PIGEON BAY, SHOWED THEY WOULD HAVE OCCUPIED MOST OF THE WATERWAY BEFORE ANTHROPOGENIC MODIFICATION.

SAMPLES OF WATER, FISH (G. MACULATUS), AND SNAILS (HELEOBIA HATCHERI) WERE TAKEN AT 4 SAMPLING STATIONS IN JANUARY 2001. WILD FISH WERE PARASITIZED BY 8 HELMINTH SPECIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE ENDEMIC IN THE REGION; THEREFORE, THE FARM DID NOT INTRODUCE ANY HELMINTH PARASITE TO G. MACULATUS. FISH CAPTURED NEAR THE FARM WERE NOT INFECTED BY THE DIGENEAN STEGANODERMA SZIDATI, WHEREAS THE ABUNDANCE OF THE DIGENCAN ACANTHOSTOINOIDES APOPHALLIFORMIS IN THESE FISH WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT IN FISH CAPTURED AWAY FROM THE FARM. THIS LOWER ABUNDANCE MAY BE EXPLAINED BY THE ABSENCE IN THIS AREA OF THE SNAIL H. HATCHERI, THE PARASITE'S FIRST INTERMEDIATE HOST, BECAUSE OF THE EFFECT OF SEDIMENTS AND AMMONIUM PRODUCED BY THE FARM.

THE HYDROLOGIC CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS AND STREAMS MEANS THAT FRAGMENTATION OF TERRESTRIAL HABITATS COULD AFFECT THE DISTRIBUTION OF STREAM FAUNAS AT MULTIPLE SPATIAL SCALES. WE INVESTIGATED HOW CATCHMENT- AND SITE-SCALE INFLUENCES, INCLUDING PROPORTION AND POSITION OF FOREST COVER WITHIN A CATCHMENT, AND PRESENCE OF RIPARIAN FOREST COVER AFFECTED THE DISTRIBUTION OF A DIADROMOUS FISH. 2. THE OCCURRENCE OF KOARO (GALAXIAS BREVIPINNIS) IN 50-M STREAM REACHES WITH EITHER FORESTED OR NON-FORESTED RIPARIAN MARGINS AT 172 SITES IN 24 CATCHMENTS ON BANKS PENINSULA, SOUTH ISLAND, NEW ZEALAND WAS ANALYSED. PROPORTIONS OF CATCHMENTS FORESTED AND THE DOMINANT POSITION (UPLAND OR LOWLAND) OF FOREST WITHIN CATCHMENTS WERE DETERMINED USING GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM SPATIAL ANALYSIS TOOLS. 3. MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE INDICATED FOREST POSITION AND PROPORTION FORESTED AT THE CATCHMENT ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE VARIATION IN THE OVERALL PROPORTION OF SITES IN A CATCHMENT WITH KOARO. 4. WHERE FOREST WAS PREDOMINANTLY IN THE LOWER PART OF THE CATCHMENTS, THE PRESENCE OF RIPARIAN COVER WAS IMPORTANT IN EXPLAINING THE PROPORTION OF SITES WITH KOARO. HOWEVER, WHERE FOREST WAS PREDOMINANTLY IN THE UPPER PART OF THE CATCHMENT, THE EFFECT OF RIPARIAN FOREST WAS NOT AS STRONG. IN THE ABSENCE OF RIPARIAN FOREST COVER, NO PATTERNS OF KOARO DISTRIBUTION WITH RESPECT TO CATCHMENT FOREST COVER OR FOREST POSITION WERE DETECTED. 5. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS, SUCH AS THE PROPORTION AND POSITION OF CATCHMENT FOREST, OPERATING AT CATCHMENT-SCALES, INFLUENCE THE DISTRIBUTION OF DIADROMOUS FISH BUT THEIR INFLUENCE DEPENDS ON THE PRESENCE OF RIPARIAN VEGETATION, A SITE-SCALE FACTOR.","ALLAN JD, 1993, BIOSCIENCE, V43, P32, DOI 10.2307/1312104; BAILLIE BR, 2002, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V36, P763, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2002.9517129; BERKMAN HE, 1987, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V18, P285, DOI 10.1007/BF00004881; BOUBEE JAT, 1997, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V31, P61, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1997.9516745; CADWALLADER PL, 1980, AUST J MAR FRESH RES, V31, P257; EDWARDS ED, 1996, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V337, P151, DOI 10.1007/BF00028516; EDWARDS ED, 1995, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V29, P467, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1995.9516680; EIKAAS HS, IN PRESS ENV MANAGEM; FAHEY BD, 1991, NZ J HYDROL, V30, P1; FAUSCH KD, 2002, BIOSCIENCE, V52, P483, DOI 10.1641/0006-3568(2002)0520483:LTRBTG2.0.CO;2; GILLIAM JF, 1993, ECOLOGY, V74, P1856, DOI 10.2307/1939943; GOMI T, 2002, BIOSCIENCE, V52, P905, DOI 10.1641/0006-3568(2002)0520905:UPADLO2.0.CO;2; GOODMAN JM, 2002, THESIS U CANTERBURY; GRAYNOTH E, 1979, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V13, P79, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1979.9515783; GREGORY SV, 1991, BIOSCIENCE, V41, P540, DOI 10.2307/1311607; HANCHET SM, 1990, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V24, P159, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1990.9516411; HARDING JS, 2003, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V37, P333, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2003.9517171; HAYES JW, 1996, J ROY SOC NEW ZEAL, V26, P139, DOI 10.1080/03014223.1996.9517508; HURYN AD, 2002, FRESHWATER BIOL, V47, P401, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-2427.2002.00812.X; HYNES H.B.N., 1975, VERHANDLUNGEN INT VE, V19, P1, DOI DOI 10.1080/03680770.1974.11896033; JOWETT IG, 1996, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V30, P239; JOWETT IG, 2001, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V35, P605, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2001.9517026; JOY MK, 2000, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V34, P531, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2000.9516955; KAUFFMAN JB, 1997, FISHERIES, V22, P12, DOI 10.1577/1548-8446(1997)022\&LT;0012:AEPORA\&GT;2.0.CO;2; MAIN M R, 1987, MAURI ORA, V14, P77; MARCH JG, 2002, FRESHWATER BIOL, V47, P377, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-2427.2002.00808.X; MATTHEWS W.

THIS WORK ALSO AIMED TO TEST WHETHER THE GENETIC STRUCTURING OF A GROUP OF POPULATIONS COULD BE PREDICTED FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE GEOMORPHOLOGIC HISTORY OF THE REGION THEY INHABIT. LOCATION EIGHT LANDLOCKED POPULATIONS WERE SAMPLED FROM COLD-TEMPERATE LAKES IN NORTH-WESTERN PATAGONIA. THE STUDY AREA COULD BE SPLIT LATITUDINALLY INTO TWO SECTORS THAT DIFFERED IN THEIR GEOMORPHOLOGY, EACH OF THEM HOSTING FOUR POPULATIONS. THE SOUTHERN SECTOR SHOWS EVIDENCE OF A HIGHER DEGREE OF GLACIAL COVERAGE, AND THE LAKES ARE PROBABLY REMNANTS OF A BIG PROGLACIAL PALAEOLAKE. LAKES IN THE NORTHERN SECTOR, ON THE OTHER HAND, SUGGEST NO COMMON ORIGIN. RESULTS SIGNIFICANT GENETIC STRUCTURING WAS FOUND AMONG THE STUDIED POPULATIONS (THETA = 0.188), BEING THE HIGHEST VALUE REPORTED TO DATE FOR THE SPECIES. SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN GENETIC DIVERSITY AND LAKE AREA AND PERIMETER. DIVERSITY ALSO SHOWED A SLIGHT LATITUDINAL VARIATION SUGGESTING THE PRESENCE OF GENETICALLY DISTINCT GROUPS OF POPULATIONS. THE COMPARISON OF POPULATIONS FROM THE TWO GEOGRAPHICAL SECTORS SHOWED THAT THOSE FROM THE NORTH HAD A HIGHER DIVERSITY, MORE PRIVATE ALLELES AND STRONG STRUCTURING, WHILE THOSE FROM THE SOUTH WERE LESS DIVERSE AND MUCH MORE HOMOGENEOUS. MAIN CONCLUSIONS NON-MIGRATORY POPULATIONS OF G. MACULATUS SHOW MUCH HIGHER VALUES OF GENETIC STRUCTURING THAN THOSE REPORTED FOR DIADROMOUS POPULATIONS. THIS FOLLOWS THE PATTERN SEEN WHEN COMPARING MIGRATORY AND NON-MIGRATORY SPECIES OF GALAXIAS. THIS AGREES WITH POPULATION GENETICS THEORY WHICH PREDICTS THAT RESTRICTED GENE FLOW WOULD RESULT IN GREATER AMONG-POPULATION DIVERGENCE. ALSO, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN POPULATIONS AGREED WITH WHAT WAS PREDICTED BY THE GEOMORPHOLOGIC HISTORY OF THE STUDY AREA. DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM ICE COVER IN THAT REGION MAY HAVE REDUCED THE HABITAT OF G. MACULATUS TO A REFUGE WITH AN IMPOVERISHED GENE POOL.

WE EXAMINED EFFECTS OF FOREST FRAGMENTATION ON BANDED KOKOPU AND LONGFIN EELS IN NEW ZEALAND. BANDED KOKOPU PREFER SMALL SHADED STREAMS WITH BOULDERY SUBSTRATES AND INSTREAM COVER, WHEREAS LONGFIN EELS ARE FOUND IN A VARIETY OF HABITATS. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE DENSITIES OF BANDED KOKOPU WOULD BE HIGHER IN FORESTED THAN GRASSLAND STREAMS, AND THE DENSITIES WOULD BE LOWER AROUND FOREST MARGINS. WE SAMPLED POOLS IN STREAMS FLOWING FROM NATIVE PODOCARP/BROAD-LEAF FORESTS INTO GRASSLAND USING GEE-MINNOW TRAPS. POOLS WERE SAMPLED LONGITUDINALLY ON EACH STREAM FROM >50 M INTO THE FOREST TO >50 M DOWNSTREAM FROM THE FOREST MARGIN IN OPEN GRASSLAND. BANDED KOKOPU DENSITIES WERE HIGHER IN INTERIOR HABITAT 50 M INTO FORESTS THAN IN GRASSLAND STREAMS. FISH CAUGHT IN GRASSLAND POOLS WERE SMALLER THAN IN FORESTED POOLS. LONGFIN EELS WERE CAUGHT IN ALL STREAMS, BUT NUMBERS AND SIZES WERE SIMILAR IN HABITATS; THUS NOT LIKELY TO GENERATE THE PATTERN OBSERVED FOR BANDED KOKOPU. WE FOUND THAT TERRESTRIAL HABITAT FRAGMENTATION CAN IMPACT STREAM FISH POPULATIONS BY DECREASING THEIR OCCUPANCY OF HABITATS IN THE VICINITY OF THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN DIFFERENT TERRESTRIAL HABITATS. 2005 TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP LTD.","BARTON, D., TAYLOR, W., BIETTE, R., DIMENSION OF RIPARIAN BUFFER STRIPS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN TROUT HABITAT IN SOUTHERN ONTARIO STREAMS (1985) NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND MANAGEMENT, 5, PP. 364-378; CHADDERTON, W., ALLIBONE, R., HABITAT USE AND LONGITUDINAL DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS OF NATIVE FISH FROM A NEAR PRISTINE STEWART ISLAND, NEW ZEALAND, STREAM (2000) NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH, 34, PP. 487-499; DAVID, B., STOFFELS, R., SPATIAL ORGANISATION AND BEHAVIOURAL INTERACTION OF GIANT KOKOPU (GALAXIAS ARGENTEUS) IN TWO STREAM POOLS DIFFERING IN FISH DENSITY (2003) NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH, 37, PP. 315-322; DAVIES, R., HERNANDEZ, L., EGGLETON, P., DIDHAM, R., FAGAN, L., WINCHESTER, N., ENVIRONMENTAL AND SPATIAL INFLUENCES UPON SPECIES COMPOSITION OF A TERMITE ASSEMBLAGE ACROSS NEOTROPICAL FOREST ISLANDS (2003) JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY, 19, PP. 509-524; DIDHAM, R., GHAZOUL, J., STORK, N., DAVIS, A., INSECTS IN FRAGMENTED FORESTS: A FUNCTIONAL APPROACH (1996) TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION, 11, PP. 255-260; DIDHAM, R., HAMMOND, P., LAWTON, J., EGGLETON, P., STORK, N., BEETLE SPECIES RESPONSES TO TROPICAL FOREST FRAGMENTATION (1998) ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS, 68, PP. 295-323; DIDHAM, R., HAMMOND, P., LAWTON, J., EGGLETON, P., STORK, N., TROPHIC STRUCTURE STABILITY AND EXTINCTION DYNAMICS OF BEETLES (COLEOPTERA) IN TROPICAL FOREST FRAGMENTS (1998) PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 353, PP. 437-451; EDWARDS, E., HURYN, A., ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION OF TERRESTRIAL INVERTEBRATES TO A NEW ZEALAND TROUT STREAM (1995) NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH, 29, PP. 467-477; EDWARDS, E., HURYN, A., EFFECT OF RIPARIAN LAND USE ON CONTRIBUTIONS OF TERRESTRIAL INVERTEBRATES TO STREAMS (1996) HYDROBIOLOGIA, 337, PP. 151-159; EIKAAS, H., (2004) THE EFFECT OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION ON NEW ZEALAND NATIVE FISH: A GIS APPROACH, , PHD THESIS.

THE FISHWAY WAS DESIGNED TO FUNCTION DURING LOW FLOWS TO COINCIDE WITH THE UPSTREAM SPAWNING MIGRATION OF G. TRUTTACEUS. PRIOR TO THE OPENING OF THE FISHWAY, NO FISH WERE FOUND ABOVE THE GOODGA RIVER GAUGING STATION (WEIR), WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 2 KM UPSTREAM OF THE RIVER'S ENTRANCE TO MOATES LAKE. FISH MIGRATIONS WERE MONITORED IN EACH SEASON BETWEEN APRIL 2003 AND FEBRUARY 2005. GALAXIAS TRUTTACEUS UTILISED THE FISHWAY IN ALL SAMPLING PERIODS. ADULT FISH MIGRATED UP THE FISHWAY PRIOR TO SPAWNING, WHILE LARGE NUMBERS OF NEW RECRUITS (SMALL JUVENILES) NEGOTIATED THE FISHWAY DURING NOVEMBER 2003 AND 2004. MORE G. TRUTTACEUS AND G. MACULATUS WERE CAPTURED ON THE FISHWAY DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS COMPARED WITH THE NIGHT; HOWEVER, LARGER G. TRUTTACEUS WERE MORE COMMONLY CAPTURED AT NIGHT WHEREAS G. MACULATUS ON THE FISHWAY WERE LARGER DURING THE DAY. THE FACT THAT FISHWAY UTILISATION BY G. MACULATUS WAS CONSISTENT DURING ALL SAMPLES AND NEW RECRUITS MIGRATED DURING PERIODS OF LOW FLOW DEMONSTRATES THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING THE MIGRATION PATTERNS OF THE TARGET SPECIES WHEN DESIGNING FISHWAYS.","ALLEN GR, 2002, FIELD GUIDE FRESHWAT; CHAPMAN A, 2003, THESIS MURDOCH U PER; CHAPMAN A, 2006, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V77, P21, DOI 10.1007/S10641-006-9051-2; CLOSE P, 2001, P 3 AUSTR TECHN WORK, P189; HUMPHRIES P, 1989, AUST J MAR FRESH RES, V40, P501; MCDOWALL R.M., 1981, RECORDS OF THE AUSTRALIAN MUSEUM, V33, P443; MCDOWALL R.

THE NEW GENUS CAN BE DISTINGUISHED FROM OTHER TRIAENOPHORIDS BY THE FOLLOWING COMBINATION OF CHARACTERS: A SMALL BODY SIZE, A LOW NUMBER OF PROGLOTTIDES, WHICH ARE LONGER THAN WIDE, A TRUNCATED PYRAMIDAL TO GLOBULAR SCOLEX, A RECTANGULAR APICAL DISC, PRESENCE OF THE NECK, LACK OF INTERNAL LONGITUDINAL MUSCULATURE SEPARATING THE CORTEX FROM THE MEDULLA, TESTES DISTRIBUTED IN ONE CENTRAL FIELD SURROUNDING THE OVARY LATERALLY AND POSTERIORLY, THE VAGINA PREDOMINANTLY ANTERIOR TO THE CIRRUS SAC, VITELLINE FOLLICLES CIRCUM-MEDULLARY, THE GENITAL PORES POST-EQUATORIAL, A SACCATE UTERUS, AND OPERCULATE EGGS. BLADE-LIKE SPINIFORM MICROTRICHES WERE PRESENT ON ALL TEGUMENT SURFACES, AND TUMULI ON ALL SURFACES OF THE SCOLEX AND THE ANTERIOR SURFACE OF THE NECK. MICROTRICHES WERE CHARACTERIZED ACCORDING TO THEIR SIZE AND DENSITY, AND TUMULI ACCORDING TO THEIR SIZE, INTER-TUMULUS DISTANCE AND DENSITY. AILINELLA MIRABILIS IS THE FIRST CESTODE DESCRIBED FROM G. MACULATUS AND THE SECOND TRIAENOPHORID SPECIES RECORDED FROM A SOUTH AMERICAN FRESHWATER FISH.","ANDERSEN K, 1979, Z PARASITENKD, V60, P147, DOI 10.1007/BF00927971; ANDERSEN KI, 1983, ZOOL SCR, V12, P95, DOI 10.1111/J.1463-6409.1983.TB00554.X; ARME C., 1976, RICE UNIVERSITY STUDIES, V62, P21; BERRA T.M, 2003, CHECK LIST FRESHWATE, P503; BOYCE NP, 1976, CAN J ZOOL, V54, P610, DOI 10.1139/Z76-071; BRAY R.A., 1994, P205; CAIRA JN, 2002, J PARASITOL, V88, P1172, DOI 10.1645/0022-3395(2002)0881172:TNSOYT2.0.CO;2; CUSSAC V, 2004, J BIOGEOGR, V31, P103, DOI 10.1046/J.0305-0270.2003.01000.X; DE PERTIERRA AAG, 2005, J PARASITOL, V91, P900; DE PERTIERRA AAG, 2002, SYST PARASITOL, V53, P183, DOI 10.1023/A:1021151225726; DEPERTIERRA AAG, 1999, NEOTROPICA, V45, P13; FLORES VR, 2004, SYST PARASITOL, V58, P217, DOI 10.1023/B:SYPA.0000032932.88512.A9; GRANATH WO, 1983, T AM MICROSC SOC, V102, P240, DOI 10.2307/3225830; HANZELOVA V, 2002, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V64, P245, DOI 10.1023/A:1016014505671; HOBERG EP, 1995, J PARASITOL, V81, P475, DOI 10.2307/3283835; IVANOV VA, 2004, SYST PARASITOL, V58, P159, DOI 10.1023/B:SYPA.0000032933.71645.1E; IVANOV VA, 2002, J PARASITOL, V88, P340, DOI 10.1645/0022-3395(2002)0880340:NNNGAN2.0.CO;2; JENSEN K, 2001, J PARASITOL, V87, P845, DOI 10.1645/0022-3395(2001)0870845:FNGAFN2.0.CO;2; KENNEDY CR, 1982, ZOOL SCR, V11, P101, DOI 10.1111/J.1463-6409.1982.TB00522.X; KUCHTA R, 2006, J PARASITOL, V92, P126, DOI 10.1645/GE-3511.1; KUCHTA R, 2004, J PARASITOL, V90, P316, DOI 10.1645/GE-3274; KUPERMAN BI, 1982, INT J PARASITOL, V12, P285, DOI 10.1016/0020-7519(82)90031-5; MENDES M.

126,WOS,ARTICLE,2006,LAMBERT P;SUREN AM,DO TOXIC BAITS CONTAINING SODIUM FLUROACETATE (1080) AFFECT FISH AND INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES WHEN THEY FALL INTO STREAMS?,NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,INVERTEBRATES; NATIVE FRESHWATER FISH; SODIUM FLUOROACETATE; 1080; TOXICITY TESTING; BACI DESIGN,"LARGE-SCALE CONTROL OF AUSTRALIAN POSSUMS THROUGHOUT NEW ZEALAND USES TOXIC CEREAL BAITS CONTAINING 1080 (SODIUM FLUOROACETATE). THESE BAITS ARE OFTEN AERIALLY APPLIED OVER ROUGH TERRAIN WHERE GROUND APPLICATION IS IMPRACTICAL. MANY SMALL STREAMS FLOW IN THESE AREAS, SO 1080 BAITS CAN POTENTIALLY FALL INTO THEM. THE ECOLOGICAL EFFECT OF 1080 LEACHING FROM BAITS WAS ASSESSED ON FRESHWATER FISH AND INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES IN FOUR STREAMS USING A BACI EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. FOUR SITES WERE SELECTED IN EACH STREAM: 10 M AND 100 M BELOW AND 10 M AND 100 M ABOVE WHERE 1080 BAITS WERE PLACED. ALL SITES WERE MONITORED 4 DAYS AND 1 DAY BEFORE AND AFTER BAITS WERE ADDED, RESPECTIVELY. SEPARATE EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED TO ASSESS IMPACTS OF 1080 ON NATIVE FISH AND INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES. BAITS WERE ADDED TO EACH STREAM TO ACHIEVE BAIT DENSITIES 10 X GREATER THAN FOUND AFTER NORMAL CONTROL OPERATIONS. THREE SPECIES OF NATIVE FISH, LONGFIN EELS (ANGUILLA DIEFFENBACHII), KOARO (GALAXIAS BREVIPINNIS), AND UPLAND BULLIES (GOBIOMORPHUS BREVICEPS) WERE PLACED INTO SEPARATE CAGES AT EACH SITE IN EACH STREAM, AND MORTALITY MONITORED DURING THE EXPERIMENT. ANALYSIS OF WATER SAMPLES COLLECTED DURING THE FISH EXPERIMENT SHOWED THAT 1080 WAS DETECTED ONLY FOR 12H, AND AT LOW CONCENTRATIONS (C. 0.2 MU G LITRE(-1)), DESPITE THE LARGE NUMBER OF BAITS PLACED IN EACH STREAM. NO FISH DIED AFTER ADDITION OF 1080 BAITS, SUGGESTING THAT ALL THREE SPECIES WERE TOLERANT TO DISSOLVED 1080 AT CONCENTRATIONS OBSERVED IN THIS STUDY. INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES WERE QUANTIFIED BY SAMPLING 10 REPLICATE ROCKS AT EACH SITE. CADDISFLIES (HELICOPSYCHE, PYCNOCENTRODES, AND PYCNOCENTRIA), ORTHOCLAD MIDGES, AND THE MAYFLY DELEATIDIUM DOMINATED THE COMMUNITY. 1080 HAD NO DETECTABLE EFFECTS ON THE INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITY. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT 1080 LEACHING FROM SUBMERGED BAITS IN SMALL STREAMS HAS NO DEMONSTRABLE BIOLOGICAL IMPACTS. BASED ON THIS FINDING, THE NEED TO MAINTAIN BUFFER ZONES AROUND LARGE WATERWAYS AS SOME COUNCILS REQUIRE IS QUESTIONED.","ANDERSON MJ, 2001, AUSTRAL ECOL, V26, P32, DOI 10.1046/J.1442-9993.2001.01070.X; BATCHELER CL, 1978, COMPOUND 1080 ITS PR; BIGGS BJF, 2000, STREAM PERIPHYTON MO; DEATH RG, 1994, J N AM BENTHOL SOC, V13, P125, DOI 10.2307/1467232; DEONIER CC, 1946, J ECON ENTOMOL, V39, P459, DOI 10.1093/JEE/39.4.459; DIGBY P.G.N., 1987, MULTIVARIATE ANAL EC; EASON CT, 1993, P NZ PLAN P, P297; EASON CT, 1999, NEW ZEAL J ECOL, V23, P129; EASON T, 2002, TECHNICAL REV SODIUM; EISLER R, 1995, 30 PAT WILDL RES CTR; FAGERSTONE KA, 1994, ROYAL SOC NZ MISCELL, V28, P33; *GENSTAT, 2001, GENST 6 COMM REF MAN; GREEN W, 2003, USE 1080 CONTROL POS; KING JE, 1946, SCIENCE, V103, P487, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.103.2677.487; LAUGESEN R, 2002, SUNDAY STAR TIM 0519, PC1; LIVINGSTONE P.

GALAXIAS MACULATUS IN THE RIVERS OF THE SOUTH COAST OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA INHABIT AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS VARIABLE AND AT TIMES UNPREDICTABLE. BY EXAMINING TRENDS IN GONADAL DEVELOPMENT, LENGTHS AT FIRST MATURITY, GROWTH AND APPEARANCE AND PERSISTENCE OF LARVAE OF G. MACULATUS IN TWO SALINE RIVERS (JERDACUTTUP RIVER AND OLDFIELD RIVER) AND ONE FRESHWATER LAKE (MOATES LAKE), THE LIFE HISTORIES OF POPULATIONS IN CONTRASTING ENVIRONMENTS WERE DETERMINED. THE STABLE CONDITIONS THAT PREVAIL IN THE LOW SALINITY, COOL WATERS OF MOATES LAKE HAVE FOSTERED AN EXTREMELY PROTRACTED BREEDING AND LARVAL RECRUITMENT PERIOD (YEAR ROUND) IN COMPARISON TO LIMITED RECRUITMENT IN THE RIVERINE ENVIRONMENTS WHICH EXPERIENCE LESS PREDICTABLE FLOW EVENTS AND WATER QUALITY (SALINITY). AN UPSTREAM MIGRATION FOR BREEDING IN THE JERDACUTTUP AND OLDFIELD RIVERS IS SIMILAR TO LAND-LOCKED G. MACULATUS IN SOUTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA AND IS A REVERSAL OF THE DOWNSTREAM MIGRATION IN MOATES LAKE OR POPULATIONS WITH MARINE LARVAL DISPERSAL, I.E. DIADROMOUS POPULATIONS. DIFFERENCES IN POPULATION DEMOGRAPHICS EXISTED BETWEEN THESE HABITATS, WITH SMALLER MAXIMUM SIZES AND SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER SIZES AT MATURATION OCCURRING IN THE RIVERS COMPARED TO THE LAKE. IN MOATES LAKE APPROXIMATELY 93, 6 AND 1\% WERE 0+, 1+ AND 2+, RESPECTIVELY; WHILE COHORT PROGRESSION IN THE RIVERS SUGGESTS THAT MOST FISH DO NOT LIVE BEYOND THEIR FIRST YEAR. AS AN ADAPTABLE OPPORTUNIST, G. MACULATUS CAN MODIFY ITS LIFE HISTORY STRATEGY AT A LOCAL LEVEL TO PERSIST IN VARIED AND SOMETIMES UNPREDICTABLE ENVIRONMENTS.","ALLEN GR, 2002, FIELD GUIDE FRESHWAT; ANDREWS AP, 1976, AUST J MAR FRESH RES, V27, P297; BARRIGA JP, 2002, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V36, P345, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2002.9517092; BAYLEY P.B., 1992, P251; BENZIE V., 1968, PROCEEDINGS OF THE NEW ZEALAND ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY, VNO. 15, P31; BENZIE V, 1968, NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH, V2, P628; BENZIE V, 1968, NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH, V2, P559; BENZIE V, 1968, NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH, V2, P606; BUNN SE, 1990, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V194, P169, DOI 10.1007/BF00028418; CAMPOS H, 1973, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V43, P301; CAMPOS H, 1974, STUDIES ON THE NEOTROPICAL FAUNA, V9, P55, DOI 10.1080/01650527409360470; CERRATO RM, 1990, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V47, P1416, DOI 10.1139/F90-160; CERVELLINI PM, 1993, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V36, P283, DOI 10.1007/BF00001724; CHESSMAN BC, 1975, FRESHWATER BIOL, V5, P135, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2427.1975.TB00127.X; CUSSAC VE, 1992, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V35, P141, DOI 10.1007/BF00002189; GALLUCCI VF, 1979, T AM FISH SOC, V108, P14, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(1979)108<14:RFATAS>2.0.CO;2; GILL HS, 1996, MAR BIOL, V125, P453; HODGKIN EP, 1989, ESTUARINE STUDIES SE, V5; HUMPHRIES P, 1992, ESTUARIES, V15, P327, DOI 10.2307/1352780; LAEVASTU T., 1965, MANUAL METHODS FISHE; MCDOWALL R.M., 1972, JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOC N Z, V2, P325; MCDOWALL R.M., 1981, RECORDS OF THE AUSTRALIAN MUSEUM, V33, P443; MITCHELL CP, 1989, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V23, P325, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1989.9516369; MORGAN DAVID L., 2006, RECORDS OF THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN MUSEUM, V23, P7; MORGAN DL, 2003, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V66, P155, DOI 10.1023/A:1023645506913; POLLARD DA, 1972, AUST J MAR FRESH RES, V23, P39; POLLARD DA, 1974, AUST J MAR FRESH RES, V25, P105; POLLARD DA, 1971, AUST J MAR FRESH RES, V22, P125; POLLARD DA, 1972, AUST J MAR FRESH RES, V23, P17, DOI 10.1071/MF9720017; POLLARD DA, 1973, AUST J MAR FRESH RES, V24, P281; POLLARD DA, 1971, AUST J MAR FRESH RES, V22, P91; RICHARDSON J, 1994, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V28, P399, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1994.9516630; SCOTT EO, 1938, PAP P R SOC TASM, P111; *SPSS INC, 1988, SPSS X US GUID",10.1007/S10641-006-9051-2,44,AUSTRALIA;AUSTRALIA;AUSTRALIA;AUSTRALIA,199,TERTIARY,MURDOCH UNIVERSITY,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,N,Y,N,N,N,N,REGIONAL,60,Y,1,11,Y,N,N,N,N,N,NA,NA,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,Y,Y,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,Y

SURFACES TESTED INCLUDE SMOOTH PLASTIC, SAND, GRAVEL (LIMESTONE CHIPS 5-20 MM), NYLON BRUSH AND TWO PLASTIC MOULDED CORES OF GROUND DRAINAGE PRODUCTS CORDRAIN (R) AND MIRADRAIN (R). SLOPES OF 15 DEGREES (1:3.7), 30 DEGREES (1:1.7) AND 45 DEGREES (1:1) WERE ASSESSED. SLOPE WAS THE GREATEST FACTOR INFLUENCING SUCCESSFUL PASSAGE, WITH THE LOWEST GRADIENT TESTED (15 DEGREES) PROVIDING THE HIGHEST PASSAGE FOR BOTH FISH SPECIES. MOST RAMPS AT 45 DEGREES ONLY ALLOWED THE PASSAGE OF REDFIN BULLIES, THESE FISH BEING CAPABLE OF `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

WE EXPERIMENTALLY TESTED IF A MULTIPLICATIVE RISK MODEL ACCURATELY PREDICTED THE CONSUMPTION OF A COMMON MAYFLY AT RISK OF PREDATION FROM THREE PREDATOR SPECIES IN NEW ZEALAND STREAMS. DEVIATIONS BETWEEN MODEL PREDICTIONS AND EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS WERE INTERPRETED AS INDICATORS OF ECOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PREDATORS. 2. THE PREDATORS INCLUDED A DRIFT-FEEDING FISH [BROWN TROUT (T), SALMO TRUTTA], A BENTHIVOROUS FISH [GALAXIID (G), KOARO, GALAXIAS BREVIPENNIS] AND A BENTHIC PREDATORY STONEFLY (S; STENOPERLA SP.) WITH DELEATIDIUM SP. MAYFLIES AS PREY. EIGHT TREATMENTS WITH ALL PREDATOR SPECIES COMBINATIONS AND A PREDATOR-FREE CONTROL WERE USED. EXPERIMENTS WERE PERFORMED IN AQUARIA WITH COBBLES AS PREDATOR REFUGES FOR MAYFLIES AND WE MEASURED THE PROPORTION OF PREY CONSUMED AFTER 6 H FOR BOTH DAY AND NIGHT TRIALS. 3. TROUT CONSUMED A HIGHER PROPORTION OF PREY THAN OTHER PREDATORS. FOR THE TWO PREDATOR TREATMENTS WE FOUND LESS THAN EXPECTED PREY CONSUMPTION IN THE GALAXIID + TROUT TREATMENT (G + T) FOR BOTH DAY AND NIGHT TRIALS, WHEREAS A HIGHER THAN EXPECTED PROPORTION OF PREY WAS CONSUMED DURING NIGHT TIME IN THE STONEFLY + TROUT (S + T) TREATMENT. 4. THE RESULTS INDICATE INTERFERENCE (G + T) AND FACILITATION (S + T) BETWEEN PREDATORS DEPENDING ON PREDATOR IDENTITY AND TIME OF DAY. THUS, TO MAKE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS, IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER THE ECOLOGY OF INDIVIDUAL SPECIES AND HOW DIFFERENCES INFLUENCE THE DIRECTION AND MAGNITUDE OF INTERACTIONS.","ANGRADI TR, 1990, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V47, P199, DOI 10.1139/F90-022; DAHL J, 1996, OIKOS, V77, P177, DOI 10.2307/3546054; DAHL J, 1997, OIKOS, V78, P459, DOI 10.2307/3545607; EKLOV P, 2001, ECOLOGY, V82, P2486, DOI 10.2307/2679930; ENGLUND G, 1997, ECOLOGY, V78, P2316; FAIRCHILD MP, 2005, J N AM BENTHOL SOC, V24, P101, DOI 10.1899/0887-3593(2005)024<0101:MPEOMS>2.0.CO;2; HAYES JW, 1996, J ROY SOC NEW ZEAL, V26, P139, DOI 10.1080/03014223.1996.9517508; HOLT RD, 1997, AM NAT, V149, P745, DOI 10.1086/286018; HUHTA A, 1999, J ANIM ECOL, V68, P917, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-2656.1999.00339.X; JENKINS TM, 1969, J FISH RES BOARD CAN, V26, P3275, DOI 10.1139/F69-316; KERFOOT W.C., 1987, PREDATION DIRECT IND; KRUPA JJ, 1998, OECOLOGIA, V117, P258, DOI 10.1007/S004420050656; LOSEY JE, 1998, ECOLOGY, V79, P2143, DOI 10.2307/176717; MCINTOSH ANGUS R., 2000, P125; MCINTOSH AR, 1994, ECOLOGY, V75, P2078, DOI 10.2307/1941612; MCINTOSH AR, 1995, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V52, P1821, DOI 10.1139/F95-175; MCINTOSH AR, 1996, OECOLOGIA, V108, P174, DOI 10.1007/BF00333229; MCINTOSH AR, 1999, OIKOS, V85, P554, DOI 10.2307/3546705; MIYASAKA H, 1999, OECOLOGIA, V118, P99, DOI 10.1007/S004420050707; NYSTROM P, 2003, OECOLOGIA, V136, P596, DOI 10.1007/S00442-003-1297-1; NYSTROM P, 2003, OECOLOGIA, V136, P279, DOI 10.1007/S00442-003-1250-3; PECKARSKY BL, 1997, J N AM BENTHOL SOC, V16, P375, DOI 10.2307/1468025; POWER ME, 1990, SCIENCE, V250, P811, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.250.4982.811; QUINN GP, 2002, EXPT DESIGN DATA ANA; SIH A, 1998, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V13, P350, DOI 10.1016/S0169-5347(98)01437-2; SIH A, 1994, ECOLOGY, V75, P1199, DOI 10.2307/1937446; SOKOL-HESSNER L, 2002, ECOLOGY, V83, P2367, DOI 10.1890/0012-9658(2002)0832367:AEOMPS2.0.CO;2; SOLUK DA, 1997, OIKOS, V80, P214, DOI 10.2307/3546588; SOLUK DA, 1988, OIKOS, V52, P94, DOI 10.2307/3565987; SOLUK DA, 1993, ECOLOGY, V74, P219, DOI 10.2307/1939516; SWISHER BJ, 1998, OIKOS, V81, P30, DOI 10.2307/3546464; TAYLOR BW, 2001, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V58, P437, DOI 10.1139/CJFAS-58-3-437; TOWNSEND CR, 2003, CONSERV BIOL, V17, P38, DOI 10.1046/J.1523-1739.2003.02017.X; VANCE-CHALCRAFT HD, 2004, OECOLOGIA, V139, P117, DOI 10.1007/S00442-003-1484-0; WOOSTER D, 1995, OIKOS, V73, P3, DOI 10.2307/3545718; WOOSTER D.

AND INVERTEBRATE FAUNA WAS INVESTIGATED IN 18 WEST COAST NEW ZEALAND STREAMS (8 WITH TROUT AND 10 WITHOUT TROUT) DIFFERING IN CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS. GUT CONTENTS OF TROUT, CRAYFISH AND EELS WERE ALSO EXAMINED TO EVALUATE WHETHER COMPETITION OR PREDATION COULD BE LINKED TO THE PATTERNS FOUND. ABUNDANCES OF CRAYFISH AND GALAXIIDS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN STREAMS WITH TROUT, BUT IN STREAMS WITHOUT TROUT, SUBSTRATE SIZE WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS DETERMINING CRAYFISH ABUNDANCE. IN CONTRAST TO CRAYFISH, OTHER MACROINVERTEBRATES WERE MORE ABUNDANT IN TROUT STREAMS THAN STREAMS WITHOUT TROUT AND SIGNIFICANTLY MORE TAXA WERE FOUND IN STREAMS WITH TROUT. MACROINVERTEBRATE ABUNDANCE WAS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, SUCH AS PH, SUBSTRATE, DEPTH AND TOTAL NITROGEN. GUT CONTENT ANALYSIS SHOWED AN OVERLAP IN DIET (MOSTLY INVERTEBRATES) BETWEEN TROUT AND EELS. CRAYFISH, HOWEVER, HAD A MORE OMNIVOROUS DIET WHERE DETRITUS WAS THE MOST FREQUENTLY OCCURRING FOOD MATERIAL. DIFFERENCES IN CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS MARKED THE STREAMS WITH AND WITHOUT TROUT. THUS, TROUT WERE NOT PRESENT IN STREAMS WITH PH < 6.0. CRAYFISH AND GALAXIIDS WERE PRESENT IN STREAMS WITH PH RANGING FROM 4.1 TO 7.9, AND THOSE WITH PH < 6.0 MAY FUNCTION AS TROUT-FREE REFUGES WHERE LARGER POPULATIONS OF THESE SPECIES MAY PERSIST. HOWEVER, OTHER MACROINVERTEBRATE TAXA MAY BE MORE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY ACIDIFICATION THAN BY TROUT. BY PROTECTING NATURALLY ACIDIC, BROWN WATER STREAMS, NEW ZEALAND CRAYFISH AND GALAXIID FISH POPULATIONS CAN BE CONSERVED WITHIN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHERE TROUT ARE PRESENT. (C) 2006 ELSEVIER LTD.

WE ASSESSED THE RELATIVE LOSSES OF HABITAT FOR DIADROMOUS FISH (I.E., THOSE MIGRATING BETWEEN SEA AND FRESHWATER) DUE TO PHYSICAL BARRIERS, DEGRADATION OF MIGRATORY PASSAGE ASSOCIATED WITH CATCHMENT LAND USE, AND SITE-SCALE LAND USE CHARACTERISTICS ON THE WEST COAST, SOUTH ISLAND, NEW ZEALAND. FISH OCCURRENCE, LAND USE DATA, AND RIVER NETWORK MODELS WERE ANALYZED IN A GIS AND SUBJECTED TO A THREE-LEVEL HIERARCHICAL ANALYSIS. TO IDENTIFY ACCESSIBLE HABITAT NOT RESTRICTED BY PHYSICAL BARRIERS, WE USED THE MIGRATORY DISTANCE AND MAXIMUM DOWNSTREAM SLOPE ENCOUNTERED TO IDENTIFY ACCESSIBLE SITES IN LEAST-IMPACTED CATCHMENTS AND APPLIED THE RESULTS TO ALL CATCHMENTS WITHIN THE STUDY AREA. FOR TWO FISH SPECIES, BANDED KOKOPU (GALAXIAS FASCIATUS) AND KOARO (G. BREVIPINNIS), SITES MODELED AS ACCESSIBLE USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION IN LEAST-IMPACTED CATCHMENTS WERE THEN USED TO ASSESS THE IMPACTS OF CATCHMENT-SCALE DEFORESTATION AND DOWNSTREAM LAND USES ON HABITAT LOSS. FINALLY, SITES NOT RESTRICTED BY PHYSICAL BARRIERS OR LAND-USE-RELATED IMPACTS ON MIGRATORY PASSAGE WERE USED TO MODEL THE EFFECTS OF LOCAL LAND USE. THE MODELS INDICATED THAT KOARO AND BANDED KOKOPU POTENTIALLY HAD ACCESS TO 28 000 KM AND 5300 KM, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE 40 600 KM OF STREAMS WITHIN THE STUDY AREA.

RIVERS ARE THE MAIN FRESHWATER FEATURES IN THESE PACIFIC TEMPERATE-ZONE ISLANDS. GEOLOGICAL EVENTS, THE ISLANDS' REMOTENESS, AND THE RECENT NATURE OF HUMAN COLONIZATION (FIRST MAORI AND THEN EUROPEAN) HAVE SHAPED THE FRESHWATER ICHTHYOFAUNA. DIADROMY IS A DOMINANT ECOLOGICAL FEATURE FOR MANY INDIGENOUS SPECIES. MANY SPECIES HAVE ALSO BEEN INTRODUCED TO CREATE FISHERIES. TRADITIONAL MAORI FISHERIES ARE FOCUSSED ON INDIGENOUS EELS AND WHITEBAIT WHILE RECREATIONAL FISHERIES TARGET INTRODUCED SALMONIDS. MANAGEMENT OF NEW ZEALAND FRESHWATER FISH IS DISPERSED AMONG SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS. NEW ZEALAND HABITATS ARE PRISTINE BY GLOBAL STANDARDS DUE LARGELY TO THE RECENT SETTLEMENT OF EUROPEAN COLONISTS. MANY RIVERS HAVE BEEN IMPOUNDED FOR ELECTRICITY GENERATION; THIS CONSTITUTES THE MAIN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE FOR FRESHWATER FISH. INTENSIFICATION OF AGRICULTURE ALSO POSES A GROWING EUTROPHICATION THREAT. THE ECOLOGIES OF INDIGENOUS SPECIES ARE BECOMING BETTER KNOWN BUT MUCH KNOWLEDGE IS ANECDOTAL. EFFORTS TO CONSERVE INDIGENOUS FRESHWATER SPECIES ARE INCREASING. IMPOUNDMENT, IRRIGATION, DEFORESTATION, AND INTRODUCED SALMONIDS, ARE THE MAIN THREATS TO THE NATIVE FAUNA.

108,WOS,ARTICLE,2007,SMITH J;BAKER C;ROWE D,AGONISTIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN GAMBUSIA AFFINIS AND GALAXIAS MACULATUS: IMPLICATIONS FOR WHITEBAIT FISHERIES IN NEW ZEALAND RIVERS,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY,NA,"LABORATORY TANK STUDIES WERE USED TO IDENTIFY THE OUTCOME OF BEHAVIOURAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN GAMBUSIA AFFINIS (GAMBUSIA) AND GALAXIAS MACULATUS (INANGA), WHEREAS FIELD DATA ON SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION WERE USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER GAMBUSIA COULD BE AFFECTING INANGA POPULATIONS IN THE WILD. MORTALITY RATES FOR JUVENILE INANGA (MEAN LENGTH 42 MM) EXPOSED TO GAMBUSIA (MEAN LENGTH 32 MM) FOR 15 DAYS AT 10 DEGREES C WERE LOW (< 10\%) AND NO GREATER THAN THOSE FOR CONTROL FISH. HOWEVER, AT TEMPERATURES BETWEEN 15 AND 25 DEGREES C, GAMBUSIA NIPPED THE FINS OF JUVENILE INANGA, RESULTING IN IMMOBILISATION AND DEATH. CUMULATIVE MORTALITY RATES OVER 15 DAYS AT THESE TEMPERATURES WERE OVER 60\%. THE SURVIVAL OF LARGER (MEAN LENGTH 58 MM) ADULT INANGA WAS ALSO REDUCED BY GAMBUSIA. ADULT INANGA OCCURRED IN 15\% OF SHALLOW (< 0.5 M) SITES WHERE GAMBUSIA WAS PRESENT COMPARED WITH 33\% OF SHALLOW SITES WHERE IT WAS ABSENT. FURTHERMORE, THE MEAN DEPTH OF SITES CONTAINING INANGA IN SWAMPS AND WETLANDS WHERE AGONISTIC INTERACTIONS WOULD BE GREATEST WAS 1.8 M WHERE GAMBUSIA WAS PRESENT COMPARED WITH 1.0 M WHERE IT WAS ABSENT. DISPLACEMENT OF INANGA INTO DEEPER WATERS IS THEREFORE LIKELY TO BE OCCURRING AS A CONSEQUENCE OF GAMBUSIA AGGRESSION. THE SPREAD OF GAMBUSIA IN NEW ZEALAND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE THE USE OF SHALLOW-WATER HABITATS BY INANGA. THIS WOULD FURTHER EXACERBATE THE HISTORIC DECLINE OF THESE GALAXIID FISHERIES RELATED TO LAND-USE CHANGES.","ALDAHAM NK, 1977, J FISH BIOL, V11, P309, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8649.1977.TB04124.X; ARTHINGTON A.H., 1999, ASIAN FISHERIES SCIENCE, V12, P1; ARTHINGTON A.H., 1989, P333; ARTHINGTON AH, 1988, AUSTR VER INT VEREIN, V23, P177; BACON EJ, 1967, P ANNU C SE ASSOC GA, V21, P411; BARRIER R.

THE G. MACULATUS POPULATION OF TIERRA DEL FUEGO HAS AN EXTENDED REPRODUCTIVE SEASON, WITH DIFFERENCES IN TIMING AND DURATION COMPARED TO OTHER POPULATIONS OF CONTINENTAL PATAGONIA, NEW ZEALAND AND AUSTRALIA. ELEVATED GONADOSOMATIC INDEXES (I-G) WERE OBSERVED DURING THIS PERIOD IN BOTH SEXES (MAXIMUM I-G = 33.49\% MALES; 35.94\% FEMALES). THE HIGH ABUNDANCE OF MATURE MALES (WITH HIGH I-G VALUES) ON THE SPAWNING GROUNDS DURING THE REPRODUCTIVE SEASON SUGGESTS THAT THEY WERE WAITING FOR THE RETURN OF THE MATURE FEMALES. LARGER FEMALES REACHED TOTAL MATURATION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE REPRODUCTIVE SEASON, WHEREAS THE SIZE OF MATURING FEMALES DIMINISHED TOWARD THE END (MEAN TL = 96 MM, OCTOBER; 70 MM, FEBRUARY). BOTH SEXES SHOWED AN EXTREMELY HIGH INVESTMENT IN REPRODUCTION, REACHING A MAXIMUM I-G OF ABOUT 35\% FOR BOTH SEXES. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE REPRODUCTIVE SEASON FEMALES REACHED THE MAXIMUM MEDIAN I-H (3.37\%) AND MALES THE MINIMUM (0.96\%), SUGGESTING DIFFERENCES IN THE ROLE OF THE LIVER IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ENERGETIC RESERVES DURING SEXUAL MATURATION. THE VARIATION IN THE FAT INDEX (I-F) SUGGESTS THAT FAT RESERVES WERE USED TO SURVIVE WINTER (MAXIMUM MEDIAN I-F > 1\%, AUTUMN; MINIMUM ABOUT 0.2\%, SPRING).","ARENAS JN, 1978, MEDIO AMBIENTE, V3, P50; BARRIGA JP, 2002, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V36, P345, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2002.9517092; BOY CC, 2003, GALAXIAS MACULATUS, V5; BOY CC, 2005, 11 C LAT CIENC MAR; BURNET A.

THE ABILITY OF DIADROMOUS COMMON JOLLYTAIL, GALAXIAS MACULATUS (JENYNS), AND SPOTTED GALAXIAS, GALAXIAS TRUTTACEUS (VAL.), TO PASS UPSTREAM THROUGH AN IN SITU PIPE CULVERT MODIFIED THROUGH THE INSTALLATION OF BAFFLES WAS ASSESSED. SPOILER BAFFLES (100 X 70 X 28 OR 56 MM) WERE INSTALLED IN THREE SPATIAL ARRANGEMENTS ALONG A 5.5-M SECTION OF THE PIPE, AND INDIVIDUAL FISH PASSAGE ASSESSED AT THREE FLOW VELOCITIES (0.35, 0.70 AND 1.0 M S(-1)). COMMON JOLLYTAILS (43-169 MM FORK LENGTH, FL) WERE 10 TIMES MORE SUCCESSFUL IN PASSING WHEN BAFFLES WERE PRESENT THAN UNDER CONTROL CONDITIONS (BAFFLES ABSENT). BAFFLE SIZE DID NOT INFLUENCE SUCCESS, WHICH INCREASED WITH THE SPATIAL COMPLEXITY OF THE BAFFLE ARRANGEMENT.

THE UPSTREAM MIGRATION OF LARVAE AND JUVENILES FROM THE SEA TO FRESHWATER HABITATS IS A CHARACTERISTIC PHENOMENON OF DIADROMOUS POPULATIONS, BUT UPSTREAM MIGRATION HAS NEVER BEEN REPORTED IN THOSE THAT ARE LANDLOCKED. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ESTABLISH THE POPULATION DYNAMICS OF A PECULIAR RIVERINE LANDLOCKED POPULATION THAT PRESENTS AN UPSTREAM MIGRATION AT THE LARVAE-JUVENILE TRANSITION FROM THE PIEDRA DEL AGUILA RESERVOIR TO THE CALEUFU RIVER (ARGENTINA). A SPAWNING SEASON FROM SEPTEMBER TO NOVEMBER AND THE ARRIVAL OF SHOALS OF METAMORPHIC LARVAE AND JUVENILES FROM FEBRUARY TO APRIL TO THE ADULT HABITAT WERE COINCIDENTAL WITH LACUSTRINE LANDLOCKED POPULATIONS, BUT NOT WITH DIADROMOUS POPULATIONS. GROWTH RATE AND AGE AT MIGRATION, 147 +/- 22.6 DAYS, WERE ALSO SIMILAR TO OTHER LANDLOCKED AND DIADROMOUS POPULATIONS. THE ARRIVAL OF THESE SHOALS PRODUCED A 20-FOLD INCREASE IN FISH DENSITY WHILE THE TWO COHORTS OF G. MACULATUS OVERLAPPED IN TIME AND SPACE. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN MORPHOLOGY OR VERTEBRAE NUMBER WERE DETECTED WHEN RIVERINE AND RESERVOIR ADULTS WERE COMPARED. THE GREAT LIFE HISTORY PLASTICITY OF G. MACULATUS, SHOWN TO BE EVEN GREATER IN OUR RESULTS, COULD BE THE KEY TO EXPLAIN THE WIDE DISTRIBUTION OF THIS SPECIES IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE. LIKEWISE, DISCOVERING THIS JUVENILE POTAMODROMOUS BEHAVIOUR IN A LANDLOCKED POPULATION WILL PROVIDE A NEW VIEW FOR THE ANALYSIS OF THE WAYS OF THIS SPECIES' DISPERSION IN CONTINENTAL WATERS.","AEPN, 2003, DAT GEOGR CLIM INF G, P404; ALLIBONE RM, 1996, BIOL J LINN SOC, V57, P107, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8312.1996.TB01832.X; ALLIBONE RM, 1993, BIOL J LINN SOC, V50, P19, DOI 10.1006/BIJL.1993.1045; ANDREWS A P, 1982, PAPERS AND PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TASMANIA, V116, P85; BAKER CF, 2003, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V37, P291, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2003.9517167; BAKER CF, 2003, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V37, P283, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2003.9517166; BAKER CF, 2001, J FISH BIOL, V58, P1221, DOI 10.1006/JFBI.2000.1528; BARRIGA JP, 2002, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V36, P345, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2002.9517092; BENZIE V, 1968, NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH, V2, P606; BERRA TM, 1996, MAR FRESHWATER RES, V47, P845, DOI 10.1071/MF9960845; CAMPOS H, 1973, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V43, P301; CAMPOS H, 1974, STUDIES ON THE NEOTROPICAL FAUNA, V9, P55, DOI 10.1080/01650527409360470; CAMPOS H., 1970, BOLETIN MUS NAC HIST NAT CHILE, V31, P5; CHARTERIS SC, 2002, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V36, P789, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2002.9517131; CUSSAC V, 2004, J BIOGEOGR, V31, P103, DOI 10.1046/J.0305-0270.2003.01000.X; CUSSAC VE, 1992, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V35, P141, DOI 10.1007/BF00002189; FERRIZ RA, 1987, REV MUSEO ARGENTINO, V6, P29; FERRIZ RICARDO A., 2001, BIOIKOS (CAMPINAS), V15, P83; GROSS MR, 1988, SCIENCE, V239, P1217; KOVAC V, 1999, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V56, P105, DOI 10.1023/A:1007570716690; LINDSEY CC, 1975, J FISH RES BOARD CAN, V32, P2453, DOI 10.1139/F75-283; LING N, 2001, J FISH BIOL, V59, P209, DOI 10.1006/JFBI.2001.1768; MACCHI JP, 2004, THESIS U NACL COMAHU; MCDOWALL M, 2003, REV FISH BIOL FISHER, V13, P247; MCDOWALL RM, 2001, FISH FISH, V2, P278, DOI 10.1046/J.1467-2960.2001.00050.X; MCDOWALL R M, 1970, BULLETIN OF THE MUSEUM OF COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY, V139, P341; MCDOWALL RM, 1971, ZOOL J LINN SOC-LOND, V50, P33, DOI 10.1111/J.1096-3642.1971.TB00751.X; MCDOWALL RM, 1994, B MAR SCI, V54, P385; MCDOWALL RM, 1999, MOL ECOL, V8, P527, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-294X.1999.00560.X; MCDOWALL RM, 1995, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V29, P271, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1995.9516660; MCDOWALL RM, 2003, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V66, P361, DOI 10.1023/A:1023902922843; MCDOWALL RM, 1998, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V53, P235, DOI 10.1023/A:1007421316768; MCDOWALL RM, 1968, FISH RES B, V2; NORUSIS MJ, 1986, SPSS PC ADV STAT; OTS J P, 1975, NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH, V9, P97; PEREDO SANTIAGO, 1994, BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD DE BIOLOGIA DE CONCEPCION, V65, P65; POLLARD DA, 1971, AUST J MAR FRESH RES, V22, P91; REVENGA J, 2003, THESIS U BUENOS AIRE; ROWE DK, 1992, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V26, P219, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1992.9516517; ROWE DK, 1996, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V46, P255, DOI 10.1007/BF00005001; SIMONOVIC PD, 1999, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V56, P117, DOI 10.1023/A:1007541915307; SUTHERLAND DL, 2001, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V35, P1061, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2001.9517063; TROCHINE C, 2000, THESIS U NACL COMAHU; WATERS JM, 1999, MOL PHYLOGENET EVOL, V11, P1, DOI 10.1006/MPEV.1998.0554; WATERS JM, 2002, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V59, P49, DOI 10.1139/F01-195; WATERS JM, 2001, EVOLUTION, V55, P587, DOI 10.1554/0014-3820(2001)0550587:CALOTM2.0.CO;2; WOOTTON RJ., 1998, ECOLOGY TELEOST FISH; ZATTARA EE, 2004, J BIOGEOGR, V31, P1; ZATTARA EE, 2002, THESIS U NACL COMAHU",10.1111/J.1439-0426.2006.00820.X,36,ARGENTINA;ARGENTINA;ARGENTINA,177,TERTIARY,UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL DEL COMAHUE,ARGENTINA,PATAGONIA,N,Y,N,N,N,N,BASIN,250,Y,1,14,Y,N,N,N,N,N,NA,NA,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,Y

THIS RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT THE DEVOLUTION OF RESOURCE GOVERNANCE IN NEW ZEALAND HAS CULTIVATED EMPOWERED, `ACCIDENTAL ENVIRONMENTALISTS' AND RELATED ENVIRONMENTAL SUBJECTIVITIES. THE EXTENT AND QUALITY OF INDIVIDUAL INVOLVEMENT IN GOVERNANCE INFLUENCES WHITEBAITERS' PERCEPTIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PRIORITIES. AT THE SAME TIME, A STRONG `ECO-POPULIST' CONCEPTUALIZATION OF RESOURCE MANAGEMENT INFUSES THE FISHERS' ENVIRONMENTAL SUBJECTIVITIES AND POTENTIALLY CONSTRAINS THE DEPTH AND DEGREE OF FISHERS' OPPOSITION TO ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION.

RESULTS SHOWED A LOWER LIPID CONTENT IN EMBRYOS AND LARVAE FROM ESTUARINE POPULATIONS THAN THOSE FROM FRESH WATER, DENOTING THE INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. THE N-3:N-6 RATIO WAS HIGHER IN EGGS FROM ESTUARINE AND CULTURED POPULATIONS, BEING IN THE RANGE OF MARINE FISHES, WHEREAS FOR EGGS FROM FRESHWATER FISH WAS LOWER AND TYPICAL OF FRESHWATER FISHES. THE POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS (PUFA), PARTICULARLY DOCOSAHEXAENOIC ACID (22:6N-3) AND EICOSAPENTAENOIC ACID (20:5N-3), WERE HIGHER IN EGGS AND LARVAE OF BROODSTOCK COMING FROM CULTURE OR ESTUARINE ENVIRONMENTS THAN IN THOSE FROM FRESH WATER. MOREOVER, THESE FATTY ACIDS MARKEDLY INCREASED AFTER HATCHING IN LARVAE COMING FROM ESTUARINE POPULATIONS, SUGGESTING THE EFFECT OF THE ENVIRONMENT ON FATTY ACID PROFILES TO PHYSIOLOGICALLY PREPARE THE LARVAE TO ADAPT TO HIGHER SALINITY CONDITIONS.

CONSEQUENTLY, VARIABILITY IN THESE COMMUNITIES IS LIKELY TO BE CONSIDERABLE. THE FISH COMMUNITY OF LAKE WAIHOLA, A SHALLOW COASTAL SOUTH ISLAND/NEW ZEALAND LAKE, WAS ASSESSED BY MONTHLY DAY AND NIGHT SAMPLING BY PUSH NET. A TOTAL OF EIGHT FISH SPECIES WERE COLLECTED BETWEEN JANUARY 1998 AND JANUARY 1999. COMMON BULLY (GOBIOMORPHUS COTIDIANUS) COMPRISED 78.92\% OF THE TOTAL CATCH COLLECTED OVER THE STUDY PERIOD. HIGHEST CATCHES OF COMMON BULLY OCCURRED IN LATE SUMMER AND AUTUMN, MOSTLY AT NIGHT. JUVENILE PERCH (PERCA FLUVIATILIS) WERE ALSO CAUGHT IN HIGH NUMBERS FOR A SHORT PERIOD IN MID-SUMMER, ALSO MOSTLY AT NIGHT. COMMON SMELT (RETROPINNA RETROPINNA) AND INANGA (GALAXIAS MACULATUS) WERE COLLECTED IN LOW NUMBERS FROM LATE WINTER THROUGH TO LATE AUTUMN. OTHER SPECIES COLLECTED INCLUDED SHORTFIN EEL (ANGUILLA AUSTRALIS), YELLOW-EYED MULLET (ALDRICHETTA FORSTERI), LAMPREY (GEOTRIA AUSTRALIS), AND BLACK FLOUNDER (RHOMBOSOLEA RETIARIA). VARIATION IN ABUNDANCE WAS ATTRIBUTED TO LIFE HISTORY AN ONTOGENIC SHIFTS IN HABITAT USE, AND CHANGES IN HABITAT STRUCTURE RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUBMERGE MACROPHYTE BEDS DURING WARMER SUMMER PERIODS.","ALLIBONE R, 1997, OTAGO CONSERVANCY MI, V36, P1; BEGG GW, 1976, LIMNOL OCEANOGR, V21, P529, DOI 10.4319/LO.1976.21.4.0529; BERGMAN E, 1987, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V19, P45, DOI 10.1007/BF00002736; BOHL E, 1980, OECOLOGIA, V44, P368, DOI 10.1007/BF00545241; BURCZYNSKI J J, 1987, NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT, V7, P106, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(1987)7<106:HAOTAA>2.0.CO;2; CLOSS GP, 2003, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V37, P301, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2003.9517168; DAVID B., 2004, DOC SCI INTERNAL SER, V160; DAVID BO, 2002, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V36, P799; ELLIOTT JM, 1990, J ANIM ECOL, V59, P803, DOI 10.2307/5015; GEHRKE PC, 1992, J FISH BIOL, V40, P695, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8649.1992.TB02617.X; GLIWICZ ZM, 1992, ARCH HYDROBIOL, V124, P385; GLOVA GJ, 2000, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V34, P507, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2000.9516953; HAMILTON DP, 1990, THESIS U OTAGO DUNED; IMBROCK F, 1996, J FISH BIOL, V49, P1; JEPPESEN E, 1997, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V31, P163, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1997.9516755; JEPPESEN E, 2000, J PLANKTON RES, V22, P951, DOI 10.1093/PLANKT/22.5.951; KATTEL GR, 1999, THESIS U OTAGO DUNED; KOON F, 1997, THESIS U OTAGO DUNED; LAMPERT W., 1987, MEMORIE DELL'ISTITUTO ITALIANO DI IDROBIOLOGIA DOTT MARCO DE MARCHI, V45, P143; LIESCHKE JA, 1999, ARCH HYDROBIOL, V146, P397; LUDGATE B.G., 2003, SCI CONSERVATION; MCDOWALL RM, 1998, FRESHWATER BIOL, V40, P111; MCDOWALL RM, 1990, NZ FRESHWATER FISHES; MITCHELL SF, 1988, INT REV GES HYDROBIO, V73, P145, DOI 10.1002/IROH.19880730203; PERSSON L, 1983, OIKOS, V40, P197, DOI 10.2307/3544583; PERSSON L, 1983, OIKOS, V41, P126, DOI 10.2307/3544354; ROBERTSON BM, 1987, UNPUB WATER QUALITY; ROMARE P, 2003, FRESHWATER BIOL, V48, P1353, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-2427.2003.01081.X; ROWE DK, 1996, ARCH HYDROBIOL, V135, P485; ROWE DK, 1994, J FISH BIOL, V45, P787; ROWE DK, 1993, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V36, P329, DOI 10.1007/BF00012409; RYDER G, 1995, UNPUB FACTORS AFFECT; SCHALLENBERG M, 2003, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V37, P429, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2003.9517178; SCHALLENBERG M, 2003, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V251, P181, DOI 10.3354/MEPS251181; SCHEFFER M, 1993, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V8, P275, DOI 10.1016/0169-5347(93)90254-M; SCHEFFER M, 1998, POPULATION COMMUNITY, V22, P357; SNEDECOR G.W., 1989, STAT METHODS; SOKAL RR, 1994, BIOMETRY; STEPHENS RTT, 1982, J FISH BIOL, V20, P259, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8649.1982.TB04707.X; SUTHERLAND DL, 2001, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V35, P1061, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2001.9517063; WANG N, 1994, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V277, P135, DOI 10.1007/BF00007295; WANG N, 1998, ECOL FRESHW FISH, V7, P176, DOI 10.1111/J.1600-0633.1998.TB00184.X; WARD FJ, 2005, J FISH BIOL, V66, P1, DOI 10.1111/J.0022-1112.2005.00569.X",10.1080/00288330709509891,11,NEW ZEALAND;NEW ZEALAND,182,TERTIARY,UOO,NZ,OTAGO,N,Y,N,N,N,N,BASIN,2,Y,1,14,Y,N,N,N,N,N,NA,NA,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N

TANK EXPERIMENTS WERE PERFORMED TO EVALUATE RELATIVE EFFICIENCY OF NATIVE AND EXOTIC PREDATORS OF G. MACULATUS UNDER TREATMENTS WITH AND WITHOUT COVER (AQUATIC VEGETATION). IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND BETWEEN PREDATORS WITH REGARDS TO DISTRIBUTION AND CONSUMPTION OF G. MACULATUS. SALMONIDS ARE MORE EFFICIENT THAN P. TRUCHA IN CONSUMING G. MACULATUS IN DEEP ENVIRONMENTS WITH SCARCELY VEGETATION; IN CONTRAST TO NATIVE SPECIES THEY FREQUENTLY USE THE PELAGIC ENVIRONMENT. ALTHOUGH PELAGIC HABITAT MIGHT HAVE SERVED IN THE PAST AS A REFUGE FROM NATIVE PREDATORS IN THE PAST, G MACULATUS NOW EXPERIENCES INTENSE PREDATION IN THE PELAGIC ZONE BY EXOTIC SALMONIDS.

THE USE OF NATURAL TAGS IN BODY STRUCTURES SUCH AS OTOLITHS HAS LED TO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF DISPERSAL DYNAMICS; HOWEVER, THE REAL KNOWLEDGE GAP REMAINS OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THE ORIGINS OF DISPERSING LARVAE. IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE SHOW THAT EMBRYONIC OTOLITHS OF A DIADROMOUS FISH NATIVE TO SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA, GALAXIAS MACULATUS, CAN BE USED TO QUANTIFY UNIQUE NATAL ELEMENTAL SIGNATURES AND IDENTIFY POTENTIAL SOURCE POPULATIONS SPREAD OUT ALONG A CONTIGUOUS COASTLINE. USING LASER ABLATION INDUCTIVELY COUPLED PLASMA MASS SPECTROMETRY (LA-ICPMS), WE ANALYSED EMBRYONIC OTOLITHS FROM G, MACULATUS HATCHLINGS FROM 10 RIVERS ACROSS COASTAL VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA, WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AMONG RIVERS IN THE CONCENTRATIONS OF ALL 8 ELEMENTS ANALYSED (13, MG, MN, ZN, CU, SR, BA, PB). MORE IMPORTANTLY, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AMONG RIVERS IN THE MULTI-ELEMENT SIGNATURE OF HATCHLING OTOLITHS INDICATE THAT SITES SEPARATED BY 10S TO 100S OF KM. CAN BE DISCRIMINATED WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THESE METHODS CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED TO EXAMINE QUESTIONS OF POPULATION CONNECTIVITY WITHIN METAPOPULATIONS OF DIADROMOUS SPECIES.","BENZIE V., 1968, PROCEEDINGS OF THE NEW ZEALAND ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY, VNO. 15, P31; BOEHLERT GW, 1996, REEF FISHERIES, P61; BROPHY D, 2004, MAR BIOL, V144, P779, DOI 10.1007/S00227-003-1240-3; CALEY MJ, 1996, ANNU REV ECOL SYST, V27, P477, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV.ECOLSYS.27.1.477; CAMPANA SE, 1999, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V188, P263, DOI 10.3354/MEPS188263; CAMPANA SE, 1994, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V51, P1942, DOI 10.1139/F94-196; CHITTARO PM, 2006, SITU EXPT ONTOGENETI, V149, P1227; CROOK DA, 2006, RIVER RES APPL, V22, P871, DOI 10.1002/RRA.941; DOWNES BJ, 1998, AUST J ECOL, V23, P8, DOI 10.1111/J.1442-9993.1998.TB00702.X; EGGINS SM, 1998, APPL SURF SCI, V127, P278, DOI 10.1016/S0169-4332(97)00643-0; FORRESTER GE, 2002, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V241, P201, DOI 10.3354/MEPS241201; GILLANDERS BM, 2002, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V59, P669, DOI 10.1139/F02-040; GILLANDERS BM, 2000, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V201, P273, DOI 10.3354/MEPS201273; HAMER PA, 2003, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V263, P261, DOI 10.3354/MEPS263261; HANSKI I, 1997, METAPOPULATION BIOL; JONES GP, 2005, CURR BIOL, V15, P1314, DOI 10.1016/J.CUB.2005.06.061; LEVIN LA, 2006, INTEGR COMP BIOL, V46, P282, DOI 10.1093/ICB/ICJ024; MANEL S, 2002, CONSERV BIOL, V16, P650, DOI 10.1046/J.1523-1739.2002.00576.X; MCDOWALL R.M., 1981, RECORDS OF THE AUSTRALIAN MUSEUM, V33, P443; MCDOWALL RM, 1994, B MAR SCI, V54, P385; MITCHELL CP, 1989, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V23, P325, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1989.9516369; PATTERSON HM, 2004, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V270, P229, DOI 10.3354/MEPS270229; POSSINGHAM HP, 1990, ECOLOGY, V71, P973, DOI 10.2307/1937366; QUINN GP, 2002, EXPT DESIGN DATA ANA; RUTTENBERG BI, 2006, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V328, P225, DOI 10.3354/MEPS328225; RUTTENBERG BI, 2005, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V297, P273, DOI 10.3354/MEPS297273; SALE PF, 2005, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V20, P74, DOI 10.1016/J.TREE.2004.11.007; SMOUSE PE, 1982, AM NAT, V119, P445, DOI 10.1086/283925; SWEARER SE, 2002, B MAR SCI, V70, P251; SWEARER SE, 1999, NATURE, V402, P799, DOI 10.1038/45533; THORROLD SR, 2001, SCIENCE, V291, P297, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.291.5502.297; THORROLD SR, 1998, LIMNOL OCEANOGR, V43, P1826; WARNER RR, 2005, LIMNOL OCEANOGR, V50, P1529, DOI 10.4319/LO.2005.50.5.1529; WATERS JM, 2000, MOL ECOL, V9, P1815, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-294X.2000.01082.X; WATERS JM, 1999, MOL PHYLOGENET EVOL, V11, P1, DOI 10.1006/MPEV.1998.0554; WELLS BK, 2003, T AM FISH SOC, V132, P409, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(2003)132<0409:RBWOAS>2.0.CO;2; ZACHERL DC, 2005, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V290, P145, DOI 10.3354/MEPS290145",10.3354/MEPS06886,33,AUSTRALIA;AUSTRALIA,176,TERTIARY,UOM,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA,N,Y,N,N,N,N,REGIONAL,700,N,NA,NA,Y,N,N,N,N,N,NA,OTOLITH MICROCHEMISTRY,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N
105,WOS,ARTICLE,2008,DOWNES BJ;SWEARER SE;HALE R,HABITAT SELECTION AS A SOURCE OF INTER-SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN RECRUITMENT OF TWO DIADROMOUS FISH SPECIES,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,CHOICE EXPERIMENT; DIADROMY; GALAXIIDAE; HABITAT PREFERENCE; RECRUITMENT,"FOR AQUATIC SPECIES WITH HIGHLY DISPERSIVE OFFSPRING, THE ADDITION OF NEW INDIVIDUALS INTO AN AREA (RECRUITMENT) IS A KEY PROCESS IN DETERMINING LOCAL POPULATION SIZE SO UNDERSTANDING THE CAUSES OF RECRUITMENT VARIABILITY IS CRITICAL. WHILE THREE GENERAL CAUSATIVE MECHANISMS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED (THE SUPPLY OF INDIVIDUALS, HABITAT SELECTION AND MORTALITY), WE HAVE A LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF HOW VARIATION IN EACH IS GENERATED, AND THE CONSEQUENCES THIS MAY HAVE FOR THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF RECRUITS. WE EXAMINED WHETHER ACTIVE HABITAT SELECTION DURING SETTLEMENT COULD BE THE CAUSE OF VARIABILITY IN POPULATIONS OF TWO DIADROMOUS FISH SPECIES USING A FIELD SURVEY AND LABORATORY-BASED CHOICE EXPERIMENTS. IF LARVAL BEHAVIOUR IS IMPORTANT, WE PREDICTED THERE WOULD BE INTER-SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN ABUNDANCE BETWEEN SITES DURING THE SURVEY, AND THAT LARVAE WOULD PREFER WATER COLLECTED FROM SITES WITH HIGHER CONSPECIFIC ABUNDANCES DURING THE EXPERIMENTS. DURING THE FIELD SURVEY, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE DETECTED BETWEEN TWO RIVERS (THE CUMBERLAND AND GREY), WITH ONE SPECIES (GALAXIAS MACULATUS) FOUND IN HIGHER ABUNDANCES AT ONE SITE (THE CUMBERLAND RIVER) WHILE COMPARABLE NUMBERS OF A CLOSELY RELATED SPECIES (GALAXIAS BREVIPINNIS) WERE CAUGHT AT BOTH SITES. LABORATORY CHOICE EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE WHETHER LARVAL PREFERENCES DURING SETTLEMENT COULD BE THE CAUSE OF THESE DIFFERENCES. G. MACULATUS LARVAE SHOWED A PREFERENCE FOR FRESHWATER OVER SALTWATER, INDICATING THAT THE FISH MAY BE RESPONDING TO REDUCED SALINITIES AROUND RIVER MOUTHS DURING SETTLEMENT. THE RESULTS OF A SECOND EXPERIMENT WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE NOTION THAT LARVAL PREFERENCES COULD BE THE MECHANISM DRIVING DIFFERENCES IN THE POPULATIONS OF THE TWO RIVERS, WITH G. MACULATUS PREFERRING WATER COLLECTED FROM THE CUMBERLAND RIVER WHILE G. BREVIPINNIS DID NOT PREFER WATER FROM EITHER RIVER.

TWO METHODS WERE USED TO EXAMINE THE MICROCHEMISTRY OF OTOLITHS: (1) LASER-ABLATION MULTI-COLLECTOR INDUCTIVELY-COUPLED PLASMA MASS SPECTROMETRY (LA-MC-ICPMS) TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN SR ISOTOPE RATIOS, AND (2) LASER-ABLATION INDUCTIVELY-COUPLED-PLASMA MASS SPECTROMETRY (LA-ICPMS) TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN BA/CA AND SR/CA. BOTH ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES DETECTED CHANGES IN OTOLITH MICROCHEMISTRY CONSISTENT WITH MOVEMENT FROM OCEANS INTO RIVERS (SETTLEMENT). THERE WAS A STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TIMING OF SETTLEMENT AS INDICATED BY OTOLITH MICROSTRUCTURE AND BOTH SR-BASED METHODS; HOWEVER, BA/CA WAS A LESS RELIABLE MARKER OF SETTLEMENT FOR THIS SPECIES. THESE RESULTS SUPPORT THE USE OF THIS SETTLEMENT MARK FOR FURTHER OTOLITH BASED STUDIES OF AGE, GROWTH AND THE RECONSTRUCTION OF SETTLEMENT HISTORIES IN G.

GIVEN THE SHORT `FAVOURABLE SEASON' IN RELATION TO OTHER POPULATIONS OF THE SPECIES (IN TERMS OF TEMPERATURE, PHOTOPERIOD AND FOOD AVAILABILITY), THE STUDY ALSO EXPLORES THE TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN FEEDING AND OOCYTE PRODUCTION AND BETWEEN PHASES OF GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION. THE REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE WAS ANALYZED BY THE MONTHLY EVOLUTION OF THE PROPORTION OF GONADAL MATURITY STAGES (DETERMINED FROM MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION OF THE GONADS). OOCYTES WERE MEASURED USING A MICROMETRIC OCULAR SCALE AND CLASSIFIED BY DIAMETER AND MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS; ABSOLUTE FECUNDITY WAS ESTABLISHED AS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HYDRATED OOCYTES PER OVARY. THE STUDIED POPULATION EXHIBITS A REPETITIVE SPAWNING STRATEGY, GIVEN THE COEXISTENCE OF POST-OVULLATORY FOLLICLES AND HYDRATED OOCYTES IN HISTOLOGICAL SECTIONS AND THE PRESENCE IN RIPE OVARIES OF AN INTERMEDIATE COHORT OF YOLKED OOCYTES READY FOR HYDRATION. INDIVIDUAL FECUNDITY IS LOWER (1422 +/- 422 OOCYTES/OVARY) THAN IN OTHER PUYEN POPULATIONS, BUT THE EGG PRODUCTION INCREASES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL REPETITIVE SPAWNINGS DURING THE PROTRACTED SPAWNING PERIOD (FROM OCTOBER TO FEBRUARY). FEMALES ATTAIN LARGER SIZES THAN THOSE OF OTHER SOUTH AMERICAN POPULATIONS (THE LARGEST FEMALE REACHING 115 MM TOTAL LENGTH), MAXIMIZING ITS POTENTIAL FECUNDITY. THE PRESENT PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE VARIABILITY OF REPRODUCTIVE TRAITS OF G. MACULATUS IN RELATION TO DIADROMIC POPULATIONS, GIVEN THAT THE BULK OF INFORMATION IN SOUTH AMERICA REFERS TO LANDLOCKED POPULATIONS.","BARRIGA JP, 2007, J APPL ICHTHYOL, V23, P128, DOI 10.1111/J.1439-0426.2006.00820.X; BARRIGA JP, 2002, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V36, P345, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2002.9517092; BOY CC, 2007, J APPL ICHTHYOL, V23, P547, DOI 10.1111/J.1439-0426.2007.00842.X; BOY CC, 2009, POLAR BIOL, V32, P9, DOI 10.1007/S00300-008-0495-Z; BUNNELL DB, 2003, EVOL ECOL RES, V5, P439; BURNET A.

MORTALITY RATES FOR THE THREE MOST SENSITIVE SPECIES (BANDED KOKOPU GALAXIAS FASCIATUS, REDFIN BULLY GOBIOMORPHUS HUTTONI, COMMON SMELT RETROPINNA RETROPINNA) WERE MEASURED OVER A RANGE OF SS CONCENTRATIONS TO IDENTIFY LETHAL CONCENTRATIONS. THE SURVIVAL OF BANDED KOKOPU AND REDFIN BULLY WAS NOT REDUCED BY SS CONCENTRATIONS UP TO 43 000 G M(-3); HOWEVER, THE 24-H SURVIVAL OF COMMON SMELT WAS REDUCED BY SS CONCENTRATIONS OVER 1000 G M(-3), AND ITS MEDIAN LETHAL CONCENTRATION (LC50) WAS CLOSE TO 3000 G M(-3). SS CONCENTRATIONS OVER 3000 G M(-3) FOR MORE THAN 24 H WILL THEREFORE REDUCE SMELT BUT NOT AFFECT THE MORTALITY OF MOST OTHER COMMON NATIVE FISH SPECIES. ALTHOUGH MORTALITY FROM HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF SS CAN ACCOUNT FOR THE SCARCITY OF SMELT IN RIVERS WITH HIGH SS CONCENTRATIONS, MORTALITY FROM HIGH SS DOES NOT EXPLAIN THE SCARCITY OF BANDED KOKOPU OR REDFIN BULLY IN SUCH RIVERS. HIGH TURBIDITY (>20 NEPHELOMETRIC TURBIDITY UNITS) IS KNOWN TO LIMIT THE UPSTREAM MIGRATION AND RECRUITMENT OF JUVENILE BANDED KOKOPU IN RIVERS WITH INCREASED SS CONCENTRATIONS. BANDED KOKOPU IS THEREFORE AFFECTED BY INCREASED TURBIDITY FROM SS RATHER THAN LETHAL SS CONCENTRATIONS. AS REDFIN BULLY WERE NOT AFFECTED BY EITHER HIGH TURBIDITY LEVELS OR HIGH SS CONCENTRATIONS, THE LOW ABUNDANCE OF THIS SPECIES IN RIVERS WITH HIGH SS CONCENTRATIONS IS LIKELY TO BE RELATED TO THE SILTATION OF BENTHIC HABITATS.","BOUBEE JAT, 1997, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V31, P61, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1997.9516745; FAHEY B.

A 0.5 M HIGH SIMULATED PERCHED CULVERT WAS FITTED WITH ONE OF TWO UV STABILISED POLYPROPYLENE ROPE TYPES: ``RUSSET LOOP'' AND ``SUPER XMAS TREE''. FOUR RANDOMISED REPLICATE TRIALS USING EACH ROPE TYPE WERE CONDUCTED TO TEST THEIR RESPECTIVE ABILITIES TO PROVIDE PASSAGE FOR ``FRESH-RUN'' BANDED KOKOPU WHITEBAIT (MIGRATING POST-LARVAL JUVENILES). THERE WAS NO STATISTICAL DIFFERENCE IN PERFORMANCE BETWEEN THE TWO ROPE TYPES, WITH BOTH PERFORMING EQUALLY WELL OVER EACH 3 H TRIAL. A HIGH PROPORTION OF FISH USED THE ROPES TO SUCCESSFULLY NEGOTIATE THE STRUCTURE (MEAN >85\% INDIVIDUALS PER TRIAL IRRESPECTIVE OF ROPE TYPE). THE HIGH RATE OF SUCCESSFUL PASSAGE OVER A SHORT TIME PERIOD SUGGESTS THAT THESE ROPES MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE, AFFORDABLE AND POTENTIALLY EASY RETROFIT TO PERCHED CULVERTS, PARTICULARLY FOR NATIVE SPECIES WITH SIMILAR CLIMBING CAPABILITIES TO BANDED KOKOPU.","BAKER CF, 2006, J FISH BIOL, V69, P668, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8649.2006.01138.X; BAKER CF, 2003, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V37, P283, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2003.9517166; BOUBEE J.

THE DURATION OF THE MARINE TO FRESHWATER TRANSITION, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POST-SETTLEMENT AGE (PSA) AND STANDARD LENGTH (L-S) AS A PROXY FOR ENERGETIC COSTS INCURRED DURING SETTLEMENT AND THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF ESTUARY GEOMORPHOLOGY ON MIGRATORY BEHAVIOUR WAS INVESTIGATED. RATE OF UPSTREAM MIGRATION AFTER SETTLEMENT WAS NOT UNIFORM. UPSTREAM MIGRATION RATE WAS SLOWEST DIRECTLY AFTER SETTLEMENT AND INCREASED WITH INCREASING PSA AND DISTANCE FROM THE RIVER MOUTH, INDICATING A DELAY IN UPSTREAM MIGRATION BY NEWLY RECRUITED GALAXIIDS. L-S DID NOT INCREASE WITH AGE, AT LEAST WITHIN THE FIRST 21 DAYS POST SETTLEMENT. THESE PATTERNS WERE CONSISTENT FOR BOTH SPECIES, IN SPITE OF DIFFERENCES IN THEIR LIFE HISTORIES, ACROSS THE RECRUITMENT SEASON, DESPITE SEASONAL VARIATION IN RECRUIT SIZE, AND AMONG ESTUARIES WITH DIFFERENT PROPERTIES.

ONE WAY THEY DO THIS IS TO USE OLFACTION, WHEREBY THEY IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO CHEMICAL CUES. ALL ORGANISMS RELEASE ODOURS, WHICH MIX WITH OTHER CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES AND AMBIENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. THE RESULT IS THAT ANIMALS ARE FREQUENTLY IMMERSED IN A COMPLEX, HIGHLY DYNAMIC SENSORY ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY MUST IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO ONLY SOME OF THE POTENTIAL STIMULI THEY ENCOUNTER IN THE FACE OF SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF BACKGROUND NOISE. UNDERSTANDING HOW ORGANISMS RESPOND TO DIFFERENT CHEMICAL CUES IS THEREFORE DEPENDENT ON KNOWING HOW THESE RESPONSES MIGHT BE INFLUENCED BY POTENTIAL INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER STIMULI. TO TEST THIS, WE EXAMINED WHETHER THE DIADROMOUS FISH GALAXIAS MACULATUS WAS ATTRACTED TO CONSPECIFIC ODOURS AND WHETHER THIS RESPONSE DIFFERED WHEN CUES WERE OFFERED IN AN ARTIFICIAL ENVIRONMENT LACKING OTHER POTENTIAL CHEMICAL STIMULI (TAP WATER) OR A MORE NATURAL BACKGROUND ENVIRONMENT (STREAM WATER). WE FOUND THAT (1) FISH RESPONDED TO BOTH NATURAL STREAM WATER ODOURS AND THOSE FROM CONSPECIFICS BUT THE RESPONSE TO THE LATTER WAS STRONGER; (2) THE ATTRACTION TO CONSPECIFIC ODOURS WAS STRONGER IN TAP WATER THAN IN STREAM WATER, WHICH INDICATES THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE ODOURS MAY BE OVERESTIMATED WHEN THEY ARE OFFERED IN ARTIFICIAL MEDIA. WE ALSO CONDUCTED A BRIEF LITERATURE REVIEW, WHICH CONFIRMED THAT ARTIFICIAL MEDIA ARE COMMONLY USED IN EXPERIMENTS AND THAT THE BACKGROUND ENVIRONMENT IS OFTEN NOT CONSIDERED. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT FUTURE RESEARCH TESTING THE RESPONSES OF ORGANISMS TO AUDITORY, OLFACTORY AND VISUAL CUES SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE CONTEXT IN WHICH CUES ARE PRESENTED. WITHOUT DOING SO, SUCH STUDIES MAY INACCURATELY ASSESS THE IMPORTANCE OF SENSORY CUES IN NATURAL SITUATIONS IN THE WILD.","ATEMA J, 1996, BIOL BULL, V191, P129, DOI 10.2307/1543074; ATEMA J, 2002, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V241, P151, DOI 10.3354/MEPS241151; BAKER CF, 2003, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V37, P291, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2003.9517167; BAKER CF, 2003, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V37, P283, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2003.9517166; BARKER JR, 1988, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V22, P321, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1988.9516304; BARNES MC, 2002, J INSECT BEHAV, V15, P269, DOI 10.1023/A:1015493118836; BRODIN T, 2006, FRESHWATER BIOL, V51, P1277, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2427.2006.01563.X; BRUMM H, 2005, ADV STUD BEHAV, V35, P151, DOI 10.1016/S0065-3454(05)35004-2; CHAPMAN MG, 2000, J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL, V250, P77, DOI 10.1016/S0022-0981(00)00180-5; COHEN J., 1988, STAT POWER BEHAV SCI, P1; ENDLER JA, 1993, ECOL MONOGR, V63, P1, DOI 10.2307/2937121; ENDLER JA, 1993, PHILOS T ROY SOC B, V340, P215, DOI 10.1098/RSTB.1993.0060; FISHER HS, 2006, P ROY SOC LOND B BIO, V273, P526; HALE R, 2006, THESIS U MELBOURNE M; HALE R, 2008, FRESHWATER BIOL, V53, P2145, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2427.2008.02037.X; HALE R, 2008, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V354, P229, DOI 10.3354/MEPS07251; HANKISON SJ, 2003, BEHAV ECOL, V14, P282, DOI 10.1093/BEHECO/14.2.282; HAZLETT BA, 2006, J CRUSTACEAN BIOL, V26, P94, DOI 10.1651/C-2595.1; HIRVONEN H, 2000, OIKOS, V88, P191, DOI 10.1034/J.1600-0706.2000.880121.X; JOHNSTONE RA, 1996, PHILOS T R SOC B, V351, P329, DOI 10.1098/RSTB.1996.0026; MCCLENNAN DA, 1997, ANIM BEHAV, V54, P1077; MCDOWALL RM, 2006, FISH FISH, V7, P153, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-2979.2006.00217.X; MCDOWALL RM, 1994, B MAR SCI, V54, P385; MCDOWALL RM, 1980, FISHERIES RES B, V20, P1; MERKENS M, 1991, J CHEM ECOL, V17, P401, DOI 10.1007/BF00994341; MOLLER AP, 1993, BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL, V32, P167; MONTGOMERY JC, 2001, FISH FISH, V2, P261, DOI 10.1046/J.1467-2960.2001.00053.X; MUMM R, 2005, CHEM SENSES, V30, P337, DOI 10.1093/CHEMSE/BJI028; OLABARRIA C, 2002, OECOLOGIA, V132, P159, DOI 10.1007/S00442-002-0940-6; OLSEN KH, 1996, J CHEM ECOL, V22, P773, DOI 10.1007/BF02033585; ORD TJ, 2007, P R SOC B, V274, P1057, DOI 10.1098/RSPB.2006.0263; PEACOR SD, 2006, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V573, P39, DOI 10.1007/S10750-006-0256-3; POLKINGHORNE CN, 2001, FISH PHYSIOL BIOCHEM, V24, P15, DOI 10.1023/A:1011159313239; SCHOLZ AT, 1976, SCIENCE, V192, P1247, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.1273590; SKELLY DK, 2005, ECOLOGY, V86, P1068, DOI 10.1890/04-1534; SKELLY DK, 2002, ECOLOGY, V83, P2097, DOI 10.1890/0012-9658(2002)0832097:EVAEOI2.0.CO;2; UNDERWOOD AJ, 2004, J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL, V300, P161, DOI 10.1016/J.JEMBE.2003.12.006; VRIEZE LA, 2001, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V58, P2374, DOI 10.1139/CJFAS-58-12-2374; WATERS JM, 2000, MOL ECOL, V9, P1815, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-294X.2000.01082.X; WERNER EE, 1998, ECOLOGICAL EXPT ISSU; WILDER SM, 2005, J ARACHNOL, V33, P857, DOI 10.1636/S03-64.1; WILEY RH, 2006, ADV STUD BEHAV, V36, P217, DOI 10.1016/S0065-3454(06)36005-6",10.1007/S00442-008-1248-Y,17,AUSTRALIA;AUSTRALIA;AUSTRALIA,162,TERTIARY,UOM,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA,N,Y,N,N,N,N,LAB,NA,N,NA,NA,N,N,Y,N,Y,Y,SEMI-QUANTATIVE,ODOUR,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N

MORTALITY IS OFTEN CONSIDERABLE AT THE END OF THE LARVAL PHASE WHEN SPECIES ARE UNDERGOING SETTLEMENT, SO INFORMATION ABOUT THE BIOPHYSICAL MECHANISMS INFLUENCING LARVAE DURING THIS TRANSITION BETWEEN HABITATS IS CRUCIAL. FOR SPECIES DISPERSED PASSIVELY, SETTLEMENT IS GOVERNED BY OCEANIC PROCESSES CONTROLLING LARVAL TRANSPORT. HOWEVER, MANY FISHES HAVE THE ABILITY TO MODIFY THEIR DISPERSAL BEHAVIOURALLY AND PATTERNS OF SETTLEMENT FOR THESE SPECIES ARE LIKELY TO BE QUITE DIFFERENT. PREDICTING SETTLEMENT PATTERNS THEREFORE REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE OF THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF LARVAL BEHAVIOUR V. PASSIVE TRANSPORT. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, DIADROMOUS FISHES FROM THE FAMILY GALAXIIDAE WERE SURVEYED TO EXAMINE WHETHER SETTLEMENT IS LIKELY TO RESULT FROM FISH SETTLING PASSIVELY (I.E. DRIVEN BY ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS) OR WHETHER LARVAL BEHAVIOUR MAY BE IMPORTANT. ALTHOUGH CATCH RATES WERE WEAKLY NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH DISCHARGE, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT FISH WERE SETTLING PASSIVELY AT THE SCALES EXAMINED IN THE STUDY.

WE ANALYZED THE ENERGY DENSITY OF GONADS, LIVER, FAT AND MUSCLE, THROUGH CALORIMETRY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS SPECIES. ENERGY DENSITY OF FAT AND LIVER WERE EXTREMELY HIGH (34.77-56.52 AND 29.54-40.77 KJ/G RESPECTIVELY). WHILE PERIVISCERAL FAT RESERVES WERE LIKELY USED FOR OVERWINTERING, LIVER AND MUSCLE RESERVES WERE USED FOR REPRODUCTION. HIGH ENERGY DENSITIES WERE ALSO FOUND IN GONADS (27.76 KJ/G IN OVARIES AND 25.84 KJ/G IN TESTES). HIGH INVESTMENT IN GONADS OF MALES SUGGESTS THE PRESENCE OF SPERM COMPETITION. THE TEMPORAL VARIATION OF THE ENERGY CONTENT OF GONADS, LIVER, FAT AND MUSCLE INDICATES THAT THE ALLOCATION OF ENERGY OCCURS BY THE INTERNAL TRANSFERENCE OF ENERGY BETWEEN ORGANS AND TISSUES.","ADAMS SM, 1982, T AM FISH SOC, V111, P549, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(1982)111<549:EPILBU>2.0.CO;2; BEAMISH R.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTOLITH MICROCHEMICAL TECHNIQUES HAS LARGELY DRIVEN THIS RESEARCH AND LED TO AN APPRECIATION OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FACULTATIVE DIADROMY IN THE LIFE HISTORY OF NUMEROUS SPECIES. HOWEVER, VALIDATION EXPERIMENTS NEED TO BE UNDERTAKEN FOR EACH SPECIES AND LIFE STAGE OF INTEREST BEFORE DIADROMOUS MIGRATIONS CAN BE CONFIDENTLY RECONSTRUCTED. THESE VALIDATION EXPERIMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH A SALINITY CALIBRATION SERIES AGAINST WHICH THE OTOLITH MICROCHEMISTRY OF UNKNOWN INDIVIDUALS CAN BE COMPARED. TO FACILITATE RESEARCH ON FACULTATIVE AMPHIDROMY IN GALAXIIDS, WE REARED THE LARVAE OF TWO SPECIES, GALAXIAS MACULATUS AND G. ARGENTEUS, IN FIVE DIFFERENT SALINITIES (2, 5, 10, 20, 34). WE TESTED WHETHER TRACE ELEMENT SIGNATURES OF FISH REFLECTED THEIR SALINITY TREATMENT, AND HENCE WHETHER OTOLITH MICROCHEMISTRY COULD RECONSTRUCT DIADROMOUS MIGRATIONS. DISTINGUISHING LOW SALINITY (2 AND 5) FROM HIGH SALINITY (20 AND 34) TREATMENTS WAS STRAIGHTFORWARD USING OTOLITH SR:CA ALONE. THE FIVE SALINITY TREATMENTS RESULTED IN FIVE DISTINCT MULTI-TRACE ELEMENT SIGNATURES FOR BOTH SPECIES (DFA CLASSIFICATION SUCCESS OF 85\% AND 92\% FOR G. MACULATUS AND G. ARGENTEUS, RESPECTIVELY). OTOLITH LITHIUM SHOWED A SIMILAR TREND TO OTOLITH SR:CA (IE. HIGHER IN SALTWATER), AND OTOLITH RB:CA SHOWED A SURPRISING NEGATIVE TREND WITH SALINITY DESPITE HIGHER AMBIENT RB CONCENTRATIONS IN SALTWATER.

HERE WE DOCUMENT RECENT CHANGES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF FIVE COMMON FISH SPECIES THAT ARE LINKED TO INTRODUCTIONS IN CHILE. LOCATION CHILE FROM 28 DEGREES S TO 54 DEGREES S. METHODS WE ASSESS THE EXTENT OF CHANGES IN DISTRIBUTION OF GALAXIID SPECIES BY COMPARING THEIR HISTORICAL AND CURRENT DISTRIBUTIONS BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE SURVEY OF FRESHWATER FISHES IN CHILE TO DATE, A RANGE THAT ENCOMPASSES THE FULL LATITUDINAL AND ELEVATIONAL RANGE OF THE GALAXIIDAE IN CHILE. WE TEST FOR RELATIONSHIPS OF THE DISTRIBUTIONS AND ABUNDANCES OF NATIVE FISHES WITH THE INCIDENCE OF INTRODUCED SPECIES. RESULTS THE LATITUDINAL RANGE OF GALAXIAS MACULATUS HAS DECLINED BY 26\%, AND MOST OF THIS REDUCTION HAS OCCURRED IN THE NORTHERN PART OF ITS RANGE. APLOCHITON TAENIATUS AND BRACHYGALAXIAS BULLOCKI HAVE EXPERIENCED REDUCTIONS (8-17\% LOSS) IN TOTAL DRAINAGE AREA OCCUPIED, AND THEY HAVE DISAPPEARED FROM, OR ARE NOW EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO FIND, IN LATITUDES 36 DEGREES TO 41 DEGREES S, COINCIDENTLY WITH AREAS OF URBAN GROWTH AND INTENSE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. THE DISTRIBUTION OF GALAXIAS PLATEI HAS, INSTEAD, INCREASED CONSIDERABLY. IN NORTHERN BASINS, G. MACULATUS HAS APPARENTLY BEEN REPLACED BY AN INTRODUCED POECILIID GAMBUSIA SP. HIGH-ELEVATION SYSTEMS REMAIN DOMINATED BY NATIVE GALAXIAS PLATEI, WHEREAS SYSTEMS AT INTERMEDIATE ELEVATIONS, ESPECIALLY RIVERS, ARE NOW DOMINATED BY INTRODUCED SALMONIDS. WITHIN DRAINAGES, NATIVE GALAXIIDS REMAIN ABUNDANT WHERE EXOTIC SALMONID ABUNDANCE IS LOW. MAIN CONCLUSIONS WE SUGGEST THAT NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN INTRODUCED AND NATIVE FISH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THE RANGE REDUCTIONS AMONG GALAXIIDAE IN CHILE. THE SEVERITY OF THE IMPACTS VARIES WITH LATITUDE AND ALTITUDE AND IS PROBABLY RELATED TO TEMPERATURE. THE EFFECTS OF GAMBUSIA ARE RESTRICTED TO WARMER SYSTEMS. NATIVE FISH ALSO APPEAR TO HAVE FOUND TEMPERATURE REFUGIA FROM SALMONIDS; IMPACTS ARE LOW IN THE WARMER NORTHERN AND COASTAL SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS IN HIGH-ALTITUDE RELATIVELY COLD SYSTEMS. NATIVE FISH ALSO APPEAR LESS VULNERABLE TO SALMONIDS IN LAKES THAN IN RIVERS. THIS STUDY IDENTIFIES WATERSHEDS CRITICAL FOR THE CONSERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY WITHIN THE GALAXIIDAE.","ACHA EM, 2004, J MARINE SYST, V44, P83, DOI 10.1016/J.JMARSYS.2003.09.005; *AL PROJ INF TECN, 2000, EST IMP AMB PROY AL; ARISMENDI I, 2006, PRELIMINARY ASSESSME; ARISMENDI I, 2009, FRESHWATER BIOL, V54, P1135, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2427.2008.02157.X; ARRATIA G., 1981, MUSEO NACL HIST NATU, V34, P3; BASULTO S., 2003, LARGO VIAJE SALMONES; BELLO MNICA, 2004, GAYANA (CONCEPC.), V68, P48, DOI 10.4067/S0717-65382004000200008; BERRA TIM M., 1995, ICHTHYOLOGICAL EXPLORATION OF FRESHWATERS, V6, P227; CAMPOS H, 1998, B MUSEO NACL HIST NA, V47, P101; CAMPOS H, 1973, NOT MEM MUS NAC HIST, V17, P3; *CEA, 2005, EV POT PESC CAP CARG; CLARKE K.R., 2005, PRIMER V6 USER MANUA; CLARKE K.R., 2005, CHANGE MARINE COMMUN; CUSSAC V, 2004, J BIOGEOGR, V31, P103, DOI 10.1046/J.0305-0270.2003.01000.X; DYER BRIAN S., 2000, ESTUDIOS OCEANOLOGICOS, V19, P77; FLECKER AS, 1994, ECOL APPL, V4, P798, DOI 10.2307/1942009; GOODWIN P, 2006, J HYDROINFORM, V8, P253, DOI 10.2166/HYDRO.2006.005; GUREVITCH J, 2004, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V19, P470, DOI 10.1016/J.TREE.2004.07.005; HABIT E, 2006, FRESHWATER BIOL, V51, P1, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2427.2005.01461.X; HABIT EVELYN, 2006, GAYANA (CONCEPC.), V70, P100, DOI 10.4067/S0717-65382006000100016; HABIT E, 2007, AQUAT CONSERV, V17, P37, DOI 10.1002/AQC.774; HARDIE SA, 2006, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V560, P145, DOI 10.1007/S10750-005-9509-9; JOWETT IG, 1998, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V32, P307, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1998.9516827; LEPRIEUR F, 2008, PLOS BIOL, V6, P404, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PBIO.0060028; LOWE S, 2000, 100 WORLDS WORST INV; MACCHI PJ, 2007, LIMNOLOGICA, V37, P76, DOI 10.1016/J.LIMNO.2006.09.004; MACCHI PJ, 1999, ECOL FRESHW FISH, V8, P227, DOI 10.1111/J.1600-0633.1999.TB00074.X; MADDOCK I, 1999, FRESHWATER BIOL, V41, P373, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-2427.1999.00437.X; MCDOWALL RM, 2006, REV FISH BIOL FISHER, V16, P233, DOI 10.1007/S11160-006-9017-7; MCDOWALL RM, 1971, ZOOL J LINN SOC-LOND, V50, P33, DOI 10.1111/J.1096-3642.1971.TB00751.X; MCDOWALL RM, 2003, T AM FISH SOC, V132, P229, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(2003)132\&LT;0229:IOISON\&GT;2.0.CO;2; MCINTOSH AR, 2000, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V57, P2140, DOI 10.1139/CJFAS-57-10-2140; MCPHADEN M, 2001, ENCY GLOBAL ENV CHAN, V1, P353; MILANO D, 2006, BIOL J LINN SOC, V87, P69, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8312.2006.00556.X; MILLS MD, 2004, OECOLOGIA, V141, P713, DOI 10.1007/S00442-004-1695-Z; NANNINI MA, 2006, ECOL FRESHW FISH, V15, P453, DOI 10.1111/J.1600-0633.2006.00177.X; NIKLITSCHEK EJ, 2002, ESTUDIO CICLO REPROD; ORREGO R, 2005, CHEMOSPHERE, V60, P829, DOI 10.1016/J.CHEMOSPHERE.2005.02.008; PARRA O, 2004, PROGRAMA MONITOREO C; PASCUAL MIGUEL, 2002, BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS, V4, P101, DOI 10.1023/A:1020513525528; PASCUAL MA, 2007, REV-METHODS TECHNOL, V6, P333; PASCUAL MA, 2007, AQUAT ECOSYST HEALTH, V10, P212, DOI 10.1080/14634980701351361; RAHEL FJ, 2000, SCIENCE, V288, P854, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.288.5467.854; RAHEL FJ, 2002, ANNU REV ECOL SYST, V33, P291, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV.ECOLSYS.33.010802.150429; RALEIGH RF, 1986, 8210124 US FISH WILD; ROWE DK, 2007, J APPL ICHTHYOL, V23, P668, DOI 10.1111/J.1439-0426.2007.00912.X; RUIZ VICTOR H., 1994, ICHTHYOLOGICAL EXPLORATION OF FRESHWATERS, V5, P5; RUZZANTE DE, 2008, MOL ECOL, V17, P2234, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-294X.2008.03738.X; SIMON KS, 2003, FRESHWATER BIOL, V48, P982, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-2427.2003.01069.X; SOTO D, 2006, REV CHIL HIST NAT, V79, P97; SOTO D, 2007, REV CHIL HIST NAT, V80, P81; TOGNELLI MF, 2008, DIVERS DISTRIB, V14, P148, DOI 10.1111/J.1472-4642.2007.00437.X; TOWNSEND CR, 1996, BIOL CONSERV, V78, P13, DOI 10.1016/0006-3207(96)00014-6; TOWNSEND CR, 1991, OIKOS, V61, P348; VILA I, 1999, REV CHIL HIST NAT, V72, P273; VILA I., 1999, B MUSEO NACL HIST NA, V48, P61; WELCOMME R.

AS GALAXIAS MACULATUS IS A DIADROMIC SPECIES, THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF SALINITY ON THE OPTIMUM DIETARY EPA/DOCOSAHEXAENOIC (DHA) RATIO FOR SURVIVAL AND GROWTH DURING THE LARVAL STAGES. LARVAE WERE FED FOR 20 DAYS WITH ROTIFERS CONTAINING TWO DIFFERENT EPA/DHA RATIOS (LOW: 0.64 AND HIGH: 2.18) AT THREE DIFFERENT SALINITIES (0, 10 AND 15 G L-1). THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SHOWED A MARKED EFFECT OF WATER SALINITY ON LARVAL DIETARY LIPID UTILIZATION IN G. MACULATUS LARVAE. THESE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT G. MACULATUS LARVAE REARED AT HIGHER SALINITIES MAY HAVE A HIGHER DIETARY REQUIREMENT FOR DHA, WHEREAS LARVAE REARED AT 0 PARTS PER THOUSAND SHOWED HIGHER REQUIREMENTS FOR EPA. THE OVERALL RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY INDICATE THAT EVEN SMALL CHANGES IN SALINITY CAN DETERMINE THE OPTIMUM DIETARY EPA/DHA RATIO AND THE QUANTITATIVE ESSENTIAL FATTY REQUIREMENTS OF FISH.

IN THE DIADROMOUS FISH GALAXIAS MACULATUS THERE IS TERRESTRIAL DEVELOPMENT OF EGGS WHICH RESTRICTS AQUATIC PREDATION, BUT EXPOSES THEM TO TERRESTRIAL PREDATORS AND A MORE EXTREME PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT. WE HYPOTHESISED THAT EXOTIC SLUGS (MILAX GAGATES, DEROCERAS PANORMITANUM AND D. RETICULATUM) AND MICE (MUS MUSCULUS) REDUCE THE SURVIVAL OF DEVELOPING EGGS AND TESTED THIS USING LABORATORY AND FIELD PREDATION EXPERIMENTS AND SAMPLING. WE ALSO TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RIPARIAN VEGETATION COMPOSITION AND DENSITY ON EGG SURVIVAL. WE FOUND THAT EXOTIC SLUGS (M. GAGATES AND D. PANORMITANUM) REDUCED THE SURVIVAL OF EGGS IN LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS, BUT THAT NEITHER SLUGS NOR MICE AFFECTED EGG SURVIVAL IN FIELD EXPERIMENTS. EGG DENSITIES WERE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE STEM DENSITY OF RIPARIAN VEGETATION AND THE THICKNESS OF THE AERIAL ROOT-MAT. EGG SURVIVAL WAS ALSO POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH STEM DENSITY AND AERIAL ROOT-MAT THICKNESS, BUT WAS NOT DENSITY-DEPENDENT. ALTHOUGH PREDATION BY MICE AND SLUGS DID NOT APPEAR TO BE A MAJOR CAUSE OF EGG MORTALITY IN OUR STUDY LOCATIONS, MORTALITY DYNAMICS COULD BE DIFFERENT IN AREAS WITH GREATER DENSITIES OF PREDATORS. ABIOTIC FACTORS ARE IMPORTANT IN EGG SURVIVAL AND THESE ARE HEAVILY MODIFIED BY THE HEIGHT AND DENSITY OF RIPARIAN VEGETATION. IT IS LIKELY THAT G. MACULATUS EGG SURVIVAL, THEREFORE, CO-VARIES WITH THE COMPOSITION OF RIPARIAN VEGETATION. (C) 2010 ELSEVIER B.V.

WE EXPLORED HOW SALINITY REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCCESSFUL FERTILISATION MAY GOVERN THE DISTRIBUTION OF ESTUARINE SPAWNING HABITAT FOR THE DIADROMOUS FISH, GALAXIAS MACULATUS, WHICH SPAWNS IN INUNDATED VEGETATION ON ESTUARY BANKS DURING SPRING TIDES. ARTIFICIAL FERTILISATION EXPERIMENTS CONFIRMED THAT SUCCESSFUL FERTILISATION ONLY OCCURS AT LOW SALINITIES (<20). THUS, WE PREDICTED THAT EGG DISTRIBUTIONS WOULD DEPEND UPON THE EXTENT OF LOW-SALINITY SURFACE WATERS IN AN ESTUARY. USING ESTUARY GEOMORPHOLOGY CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES, WHICH CLASSIFY ESTUARIES BY PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS THEIR SALINITY DYNAMICS, WE HYPOTHESISED THAT STRATIFIED ESTUARIES WOULD PROVIDE A GREATER EXTENT OF LOW SALINITY SURFACE WATER THAN WELL-MIXED ESTUARIES. THIS PREDICTION WAS SUPPORTED BY SURVEYS OF EGG DISTRIBUTIONS IN FIVE ESTUARIES IN VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA. EGGS WERE DISTRIBUTED OVER A GREATER PROPORTION OF `STRATIFIED' V. `MIXED' ESTUARY TYPES. WE SUGGEST THAT COMBINING KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPAWNING REQUIREMENTS OF A SPECIES AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE HABITAT, SUCH AS THOSE ENCAPSULATED IN ESTUARY GEOMORPHIC CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES, CAN GREATLY FACILITATE EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY CRITICAL HABITATS AND THUS AID IN SPECIES MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION.","ARNOTT GH, 1985, AUST J MAR FRESH RES, V36, P433; BENZIE V, 1968, P NZ ECOLOGICAL SOC, V15, P13; BERRA TM, 1996, MAR FRESHWATER RES, V47, P845, DOI 10.1071/MF9960845; BLACKBURN M., 1950, AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH, V1, P155; BUFFINGTON JM, 2004, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V61, P2085, DOI 10.1139/F04-141; COWARD K, 2002, REV FISH BIOL FISHER, V12, P33, DOI 10.1023/A:1022613404123; DAVENPORT J, 1993, J FISH BIOL, V43, P121; EDGAR GJ, 2000, BIOL CONSERV, V92, P383, DOI 10.1016/S0006-3207(99)00111-1; GREENWOOD PJ, 1981, J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL, V51, P119, DOI 10.1016/0022-0981(81)90124-6; GRIFFIN RN, 1998, CLUPEA PALLASI BIOL, V194, P25, DOI DOI 10.2307/1542510; GUNTER G, 1961, LIMNOL OCEANOGR, V6, P182, DOI 10.4319/LO.1961.6.2.0182; HARRIS PT, 2002, J SEDIMENT RES, V72, P858, DOI 10.1306/040902720858; HICKFORD MJH, 2010, J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL, V385, P66, DOI 10.1016/J.JEMBE.2010.01.010; HOLLIDAY FGT, 1969, EFFECT SALINITY EGGS, P293; KONDOLF GM, 2000, T AM FISH SOC, V129, P262, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129\&LT;0262:ASSGQ\&GT;2.0.CO;2; KURUP GR, 1998, ESTUAR COAST SHELF S, V47, P191, DOI 10.1006/ECSS.1998.0346; MARDONES A, 2008, AQUAC RES, V39, P731, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2109.2008.01925.X; MAY RC, 1975, FISH B-NOAA, V73, P1; MCDOWALL R.M., 1981, RECORDS OF THE AUSTRALIAN MUSEUM, V33, P443; MCDOWALL R.

EARLY INTRODUCTIONS WERE JUSTIFIED BY GOVERNMENTS ON PURELY UTILITARIAN ARGUMENTS AS IT WAS FELT THAT TRANSLOCATED SALMONIDS WOULD CAPITALIZE ON OTHERWISE `UNDERUTILIZED' AQUATIC NICHES. A CENTURY LATER, EXOTIC SALMONIDS ARE ESTABLISHED IN NEARLY ALL PLACES WHERE THEY WERE ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED AND BEYOND, AND CONSTITUTE ONE OF THE MAIN THREATS TO ENDEMIC FISH FAUNA, AMONGST WHICH GALAXIID FISHES HAVE PERHAPS BEEN IMPACTED THE MOST. WE SCREENED THE LITERATURE TO DOCUMENT THE CHANGING PERSPECTIVES ON EXOTIC SALMONIDS IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE, AND EMPLOYED SWOT ANALYSIS TO ASSESS THE CONSERVATION PROGNOSIS OF NATIVE GALAXIIDS IN THE FACE OF SALMONID INVASIONS. OUR ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT OPINIONS DIFFER AND CONTRADICTIONS ABOUND AS TO HOW TO PREVENT FURTHER SALMONID ENCROACHMENT. THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO LACK OF INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT OF EXOTICS BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY, BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS OFTEN APPROACHED MERELY FROM A SOCIO-ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE. SPORT FISHERMEN, FOR EXAMPLE, ACTIVELY SUPPORT THE STOCKING OF RIVERS TO ENHANCE SPORT FISHERIES AND ARGUE IN FAVOUR OF CONSIDERING ESTABLISHED SALMONIDS AS PART OF THE NATIVE BIODIVERSITY, BUT ALSO WANT TO SEE AN END TO SALMONIDS ESCAPING FROM FISH FARMS. THE SALMON INDUSTRY TENDS TO STRESS THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS BROUGHT ABOUT BY AQUACULTURE, BUT CONTINUES TO DEMAND THE RIGHT TO EXPAND AND SELF-REGULATE. GOVERNMENTS, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAVE NOT ALWAYS HAD CONSISTENT OR CLEAR POLICIES ON EXOTIC SALMONIDS, AND HAVE TENDED TO FAVOUR SOME STAKEHOLDERS AND PENALIZED OTHERS. OUR ANALYSIS EMPHASIZES THE NEED TO CONSIDER BIOLOGICALLY MEANINGFUL TIME SCALES WHEN ASSESSING IMPACTS ON BIODIVERSITY, AND STRESSES THE NEED TO ANTICIPATE SHIFTS IN PUBLIC OPINION AND STAKEHOLDER SUPPORT IN CONSERVATION.","ALLEN KR, 1951, NZ MARINE DEP FISHER, V10, P231; ALLIBONE RM, 1993, BIOL J LINN SOC, V50, P19, DOI 10.1006/BIJL.1993.1045; ARCHEY G, 1915, P NZ I, V47, P295; ARISMENDI I, 2007, REV FISH SCI, V15, P311, DOI 10.1080/10641260701484655; ARISMENDI I, 2009, THESIS U AUSTRAL CHI; ARISMENDI I, 2009, FRESHWATER BIOL, V54, P1135, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2427.2008.02157.X; AYLLON F, 2006, J EVOLUTION BIOL, V19, P1352, DOI 10.1111/J.1420-9101.2005.01075.X; BAIGUN C, 2003, ORG DIVERS EVOL, V3, P151, DOI 10.1078/1439-6092-00075; BARRIGA JP, 2007, J APPL ICHTHYOL, V23, P128, DOI 10.1111/J.1439-0426.2006.00820.X; BASULTO S., 2003, LARGO VIAJE SALMONES; BECKER LA, 2007, CONSERV BIOL, V21, P1347, DOI 10.1111/J.1523-1739.2007.00761.X; BISSON P.

THIS FRESHWATER GALAXIID WAS THOUGHT PREVIOUSLY TO BE CONFINED TO A NUMBER OF RIVER SYSTEMS EAST OF ALBANY IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA. BETWEEN 2005 AND 2009, FOUR SPECIMENS OF G. TRUTTACEUS WERE CAPTURED IN THE KENTDALE CREEK, WHICH FLOWS INTO THE KENT RIVER WEST OF DENMARK. ALL FOUR SPECIMENS WERE LARGE, PRESUMABLY MATURE, INDIVIDUALS, WITH TOTAL LENGTHS (TL) 140 MM, AND THE LARGEST WAS 12 MM LONGER THAN THE MAXIMUM SIZE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA. THE KENTDALE CREEK DRIES COMPLETELY BETWEEN DECEMBER AND MAY, AND HENCE IT IS LIKELY THAT THE FISH EITHER MOVE INTO THE ADJACENT STRETCH OF THE KENT RIVER, WHICH CONTINUES TO FLOW EVEN DURING THE DRIEST MONTHS, OR THEY PERISH.

IN THIS STUDY, WE EVALUATE THE INFLUENCE THAT QUATERNARY GLACIAL ICE HAD ON THE GENETIC DIVERSITY OF TWO CONGENERIC FISH SPECIES, THE DIADROMOUS GALAXIAS MACULATUS AND THE NONDIADROMOUS GALAXIAS PLATEI, USING MULTILOCUS ESTIMATES OF EFFECTIVE POPULATION SIZE THROUGH TIME. MID-QUATERNARY GLACIATIONS HAD FAR-REACHING CONSEQUENCES FOR BOTH SPECIES. GALAXIAS MACULATUS AND G. PLATEI EACH EXPERIENCED SEVERE GENETIC BOTTLENECKS DURING THE PERIOD WHEN PATAGONIA ICE SHEET ADVANCE REACHED ITS MAXIMUM POSITIONS C. 1.10.6 MA. CONCORDANT DROPS IN EFFECTIVE SIZE DURING THIS TIME SUGGEST THAT RANGE SIZES WERE UNDER SIMILAR CONSTRAINTS. IT IS THEREFORE UNLIKELY THAT COASTAL (BRACKISH/MARINE) ENVIRONMENTS SERVED AS A SIGNIFICANT REFUGE FOR G. MACULATUS DURING GLACIAL PERIODS. AN EARLIER ONSET OF POPULATION DECLINES FOR G. PLATEI SUGGESTS THAT THIS SPECIES WAS VULNERABLE TO MODEST GLACIAL ADVANCES. DECLINES IN EFFECTIVE SIZES WERE CONTINUOUS FOR BOTH SPECIES AND LASTED INTO THE LATE-PLEISTOCENE. HOWEVER, G. MACULATUS EXHIBITED A STRONG POPULATION RECOVERY DURING THE LATE-QUATERNARY (C. 400 000 BP). UNUSUALLY LONG AND WARM INTERGLACIALS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LATE-QUATERNARY MAY HAVE HELPED TO FACILITATE A STRONG POPULATION REBOUND IN THIS PRIMARILY COASTAL SPECIES.","MARTINEZ OA, 2011, BIOL J LINN SOC, V103, P336, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8312.2011.01651.X; ALLEN G.

AFTER 1 WEEK OF EXTENDED INCUBATION, LARVAE WERE LARGER (LONGER IN STANDARD LENGTH, L-S, AND GREATER IN BODY DEPTH) COMPARED TO CONTROLS (LARVAE THAT EXPERIENCED NORMAL INCUBATION DURATIONS). AFTER 2 WEEKS OF EXTENDED INCUBATION, LARVAE WERE SMALLER (SHORTER IN L-S AND SMALLER IN BODY DEPTH) THAN LARVAE THAT EXPERIENCED 1 WEEK OF EXTENDED INCUBATION. FURTHERMORE, EYE AREA INCREASED WHILE YOLK-SAC SIZE DECREASED MONOTONICALLY WITH INCREASING INCUBATION DURATION. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT LARVAE EXPERIENCING LONG PERIODS OF EXTENDED INCUBATION ARE USING SOMATIC TISSUE TO MEET THEIR METABOLIC DEMANDS. LARVAE THAT EXPERIENCED 2 WEEKS OF EXTENDED INCUBATION SUCCUMBED TO STARVATION SOONER THAN CONTROL LARVAE, BUT HATCHING SUCCESS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. TEMPERATURE MEDIATED THE EFFECT OF EXTENDED INCUBATION ON THE MORPHOLOGY OF LARVAE AT HATCHING, MOST LIKELY, THROUGH ITS EFFECTS ON DEVELOPMENTAL RATE AND EFFICIENCY OF YOLK UTILIZATION. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF TERRESTRIAL SPAWNING WITH EXTENDED INCUBATION, WHICH WILL ASSIST IN DETERMINING WHY THIS INTRIGUING BEHAVIOUR HAS EVOLVED SEVERAL TIMES IN A DIVERSE RANGE OF TAXA.

83,WOS,ARTICLE,2011,SCHIEL DR;HICKFORD MJ,"SYNERGISTIC INTERACTIONS WITHIN DISTURBED HABITATS BETWEEN TEMPERATURE, RELATIVE HUMIDITY AND UVB RADIATION ON EGG SURVIVAL IN A DIADROMOUS FISH",PLOS ONE,NA,"ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS, INCLUDING URBANIZATION, DEFORESTATION, FARMING, AND LIVESTOCK GRAZING HAVE ALTERED RIPARIAN MARGINS WORLDWIDE. ONE EFFECT OF CHANGES TO RIPARIAN VEGETATION IS THAT THE GROUND-LEVEL LIGHT, TEMPERATURE, AND HUMIDITY ENVIRONMENT HAS ALSO BEEN ALTERED. GALAXIAS MACULATUS, ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY DISTRIBUTED FISHES OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE, LAYS EGGS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BENEATH RIPARIAN VEGETATION IN TIDALLY INFLUENCED REACHES OF RIVERS. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE SURVIVAL OF THESE EGGS IS GREATLY AFFECTED BY THE MICRO-ENVIRONMENT AFFORDED BY VEGETATION, PARTICULARLY RELATING TO TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY AND UVB RADIATION. WE EXPERIMENTALLY REDUCED RIPARIAN VEGETATION HEIGHT AND ALTERED SHADING CHARACTERISTICS, TRACKED EGG SURVIVAL, AND USED SMALL GROUND-LEVEL TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY AND UVB SENSORS TO RELATE SURVIVAL TO GROUND-LEVEL EFFECTS AROUND EGG MASSES. THE GROUND-LEVEL PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT WAS MARKEDLY DIFFERENT FROM THE SURROUNDING AMBIENT CONDITIONS. TALL DENSE RIPARIAN VEGETATION MODIFIED AMBIENT CONDITIONS TO PRODUCE A BUFFERED TEMPERATURE REGIME WITH CONSTANT HIGH RELATIVE HUMIDITY, GENERALLY ABOVE 90\%, AND NEGLIGIBLE UVB RADIATION AT GROUND-LEVEL. WHERE VEGETATION HEIGHT WAS REDUCED, FREQUENT HIGH TEMPERATURES, LOW HUMIDITY, AND HIGH UVB IRRADIANCES REDUCED EGG SURVIVAL BY UP TO 95\%. TEMPERATURE EFFECTS ON EGG SURVIVAL WERE PROBABLY INDIRECT, THROUGH REDUCED HUMIDITY, BECAUSE DEVELOPING EGGS ARE KNOWN TO SURVIVE IN A WIDE RANGE OF TEMPERATURES. IN THIS STUDY, IT WAS REMARKABLE HOW SUCH SMALL VARIATIONS IN RELATIVELY SMALL SITES COULD HAVE SUCH A LARGE EFFECT ON EGG SURVIVAL. IT APPEARS THAT MODIFICATIONS TO RIPARIAN VEGETATION AND THE ASSOCIATED CHANGES IN THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF EGG LAYING SITES ARE MAJOR MECHANISMS AFFECTING EGG SURVIVAL. THE IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH VEGETATIONAL CHANGES THROUGH HUMAN-INDUCED DISTURBANCES ARE COMPLEX YET POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING. THESE EFFECTS ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY AFFECT A VERY SMALL PORTION OF HABITAT THAT IS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE LIFE HISTORY OF A SPECIES, DESPITE THE WIDE DISTRIBUTION OF ADULTS AND JUVENILES ACROSS AQUATIC AND MARINE ENVIRONMENTS.","ANDERSON M, 2008, PERMANOVA PRIMER GUI; ANDERSON M.

HOWEVER, THE FISHERIES HAVE BEEN RAPIDLY DECREASING DUE TO THE OVEREXPLOITATION AND THE PREDATION OF INTRODUCED SPECIES. BECAUSE OF THESE EVENTS, THERE IS A NEED TO DETERMINE A CARRYING CAPACITY FOR AN INTENSIVE FISH CULTURE. IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE STOCKING DENSITIES FOR FISH CULTURE, THIS PAPER PROPOSES OBJECTIVES TO DETERMINE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION (OC) RATES, DISSOLVED OXYGEN CONCENTRATIONS THAT PRODUCE SIGNS OF HYPOXIA AND THE AVERAGE TIME ELAPSED BETWEEN FOOD INTAKE AND PEAK OC IN G. MACULATUS. IN THE OXYGEN EXPERIMENTS UNDER ROUTINE METABOLISM CONDITIONS, WE FOUND THAT G. MACULATUS ADULTS AND WHITEBAIT SHOWED SIGNS OF ASPHYXIA AT DISSOLVED OXYGEN CONCENTRATIONS BETWEEN 1.3 AND 2.2 MG L-1 AND THAT ADULTS TOLERATED DISSOLVED OXYGEN LEVELS AS LOW AS 1.3 MG L-1. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT G. MACULATUS INDIVIDUALS WITH AN AVERAGE WEIGHT OF 0.04 G CONSUMED 0.048 MG O(2) H-1, WHEREAS INDIVIDUALS WITH AN AVERAGE WEIGHT OF 1.4 G CONSUMED 0.345 MG O(2) H-1. GALAXIAS MACULATUS INCREASED THE OC RATE BY 31\%, FROM 0.39 TO 0.51 MG O(2) H-1 G-1, OCCURRING 14 MIN AFTER FOOD INTAKE. THE CARRYING CAPACITIES FOR INDUSTRIAL CULTURES OF G. MACULATUS, WERE ESTIMATED USING AN ALLOMETRIC EQUATION (OC=0.2363 X W0.612), A WATER FLOW RATE OF 1 M3 H-1 AND AN INPUT OXYGEN CONCENTRATION OF 10 MG L-1 AT 12 DEGREES C. THE DENSITY CULTURE OF WHITEBAIT (4 G) CAN BE ALLOWED TO REACH 8-11 KG M-3; THEREFORE, THESE STOCKING DENSITIES REDUCE THE RISK OF HYPOXIA AND MORTALITY, ENSURING THE APPROPRIATE GROWTH AND FEED CONVERSION RATES.","ARMESTO J, 1997, ECOLOGIA BOSQUES NAT, V21, P405; BARILE J., 2003, ANTECEDENTES CULTIVO; BAYNE B.L., 1985, EFFECTS STRESS POLLU; BEAMISH F.

DEGRADATION OF CRITICAL, LIFE STAGE-SPECIFIC HABITATS CAN THEREFORE LEAD TO POPULATION BOTTLENECKS AND DEMOGRAPHIC DEFICITS IN SUB-POPULATIONS. THE RIPARIAN ZONE OF WATERWAYS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPACTED AREAS OF THE COASTAL ZONE BECAUSE OF URBANISATION, DEFORESTATION, FARMING AND LIVESTOCK GRAZING. WE HYPOTHESISED THAT SINK POPULATIONS CAN RESULT FROM ALTERATIONS OF HABITATS CRITICAL TO THE EARLY LIFE STAGES OF DIADROMOUS FISH THAT USE THIS ZONE, AND TESTED THIS WITH FIELD-BASED SAMPLING AND EXPERIMENTS. WE FOUND THAT FOR GALAXIAS MACULATUS, ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY DISTRIBUTED FISHES OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE, OBLIGATE RIPARIAN SPAWNING HABITAT WAS VERY LIMITED AND HIGHLY VULNERABLE TO DISTURBANCE ACROSS 14 RIVERS IN NEW ZEALAND. EGGS WERE LAID ONLY DURING SPRING TIDES, IN THE HIGHEST TIDALLY INFLUENCED VEGETATION OF WATERWAYS. EGG SURVIVAL INCREASED TO > 90\% WHEN LAID IN THREE RIPARIAN PLANT SPECIES AND WHERE STEM DENSITIES WERE GREAT ENOUGH TO PREVENT DESICCATION, COMPARED TO NO SURVIVAL WHERE VEGETATION WAS COMPRISED OF OTHER SPECIES OR WAS LESS DENSE. EXPERIMENTAL EXCLUSION OF LIVESTOCK, ONE OF THE MAJOR SOURCES OF RIPARIAN DEGRADATION IN RURAL WATERWAYS, RESULTED IN QUICK REGENERATION, A TENFOLD INCREASE IN EGG LAYING BY FISH AND A THREEFOLD INCREASE IN SURVIVAL, COMPARED TO ADJACENT CONTROLS. OVERALL, THERE WAS AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RIVER SIZE AND EGG PRODUCTION. SOME OF THE LARGEST RIVERS HAD LITTLE OR NO SPAWNING HABITAT AND VERY LITTLE EGG PRODUCTION, EFFECTIVELY BECOMING SINK POPULATIONS DESPITE SUPPORTING LARGE ADULT POPULATIONS, WHEREAS SOME OF THE SMALLEST PRISTINE STREAMS PRODUCED MILLIONS OF EGGS. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT EVEN A WIDE-RANGING SPECIES WITH MANY ROBUST ADULT POPULATIONS CAN BE COMPROMISED IF A STAGE-SPECIFIC HABITAT REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A LIFE HISTORY IS DEGRADED BY LOCALISED OR MORE DIFFUSE IMPACTS.","ALLIBONE R, 1999, WATER ATMOSPHERE, V7, P11; BATTIN J, 2004, CONSERV BIOL, V18, P1482, DOI 10.1111/J.1523-1739.2004.00417.X; BELSKY AJ, 1999, J SOIL WATER CONSERV, V54, P419; BENZIE V., 1968, PROCEEDINGS OF THE NEW ZEALAND ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY, VNO. 15, P31; BUSH J, 2008, W COAST WHITEBAITERS; CHAPMAN A, 2006, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V77, P21, DOI 10.1007/S10641-006-9051-2; DELIBES M, 2001, AM NAT, V158, P277, DOI 10.1086/321319; DELIBES M, 2001, ECOL LETT, V4, P401, DOI 10.1046/J.1461-0248.2001.00254.X; DEMARTINI EDWARD E., 1999, P143, DOI 10.1016/B978-012356040-7/50009-3; DIAS PC, 1996, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V11, P326, DOI 10.1016/0169-5347(96)10037-9; DOAK DF, 1995, CONSERV BIOL, V9, P1370, DOI 10.1046/J.1523-1739.1995.09061370.X; GEIGER R, 2003, CLIMATE NEAR GROUND; GILROY JJ, 2007, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V22, P351, DOI 10.1016/J.TREE.2007.03.014; GISBERT E, 2008, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V602, P87, DOI 10.1007/S10750-008-9284-5; GRIMES CB, 1996, MAR FRESHWATER RES, V47, P191, DOI 10.1071/MF9960191; GUNDERSEN G, 2001, ECOL LETT, V4, P14, DOI 10.1046/J.1461-0248.2001.00182.X; HICKFORD MJH, 2010, J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL, V385, P66, DOI 10.1016/J.JEMBE.2010.01.010; HICKFORD MJH, 2003, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V252, P255, DOI 10.3354/MEPS252255; JOHNSON DM, 2004, ECOLOGY, V85, P2037, DOI 10.1890/03-0508; KAPPEL CV, 2005, FRONT ECOL ENVIRON, V3, P275, DOI 10.2307/3868490; KAUFFMAN JB, 1984, J RANGE MANAGE, V37, P430, DOI 10.2307/3899631; KAWECKI TJ, 2008, ANNU REV ECOL EVOL S, V39, P321, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV.ECOLSYS.38.091206.095622; KAWECKI TJ, 2002, AM NAT, V160, P333, DOI 10.1086/341519; KENNISH MJ, 2002, ENVIRON CONSERV, V29, P78, DOI 10.1017/S0376892902000061; KINLAN BP, 2005, DIVERS DISTRIB, V11, P139, DOI 10.1111/J.1366-9516.2005.00158.X; LUCAS MC, 2009, FRESHWATER BIOL, V54, P621, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2427.2008.02136.X; MARTIN KLM, 2004, PHYSIOL BIOCHEM ZOOL, V77, P750, DOI 10.1086/421755; MCDOWALL RM, 2006, FISH FISH, V7, P153, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-2979.2006.00217.X; MCDOWALL R.

OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT PATCH USE BY BANDED KOKOPU WAS CLEARLY SIZE-RELATED. SMALL FISH (90 MM) OCCUPIED SHALLOW POOLS WITH FAST VELOCITIES OVER FINE SUBSTRATUM, WHEREAS LARGE FISH (90 MM) PREFERRED DEEPER POOLS WITH SLOWER WATER VELOCITIES AND COARSE SUBSTRATES.

THE MAIN OBJECTIVES WERE THEREFORE TO INVESTIGATE HOW DIFFERENT CULVERT CHARACTERISTICS (E. G. HEIGHT, LENGTH, ANGLE, PERCHED V. NON-PERCHED) AND HABITAT VARIABLES (E. G. WATER VELOCITY, RIVERBED GRADIENT) AFFECT THE PASSAGE SUCCESS OF JUVENILE INANGA (GALAXIAS MACULATUS), A WEAK-SWIMMING MIGRATORY FISH. WE DETERMINED WHETHER PASSAGE OF JUVENILE G. MACULATUS COULD BE IMPROVED BY INSTALLING A RAMP AT THIRTEEN REPLICATE IN SITU CULVERTS IN NELSON CITY, NEW ZEALAND. AS EXPECTED, NONE OF THE 400 FISH TESTED WERE ABLE TO PASS UNDERCUT (I.E. PERCHED) CULVERTS BEFORE RAMP INSTALLATION (0\% PASSAGE), COMPARED WITH THE 250 FISH (65\% PASSAGE) THAT WERE ABLE TO PASS NON-PERCHED CULVERTS. SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FISH (44\% PASSAGE) REACHED PERCHED CULVERT OUTLETS WHEN AIDED BY THE RAMP. PASSAGE SUCCESS WITH THE RAMP DEPENDED ON ITS LENGTH AND ANGLE, WITH FEWER FISH PASSING LONGER OR STEEPER RAMPS. TO PROVIDE UPSTREAM PASSAGE FOR WEAK-SWIMMING SPECIES SUCH AS JUVENILE (FORK LENGTH<60 MM) G. MACULATUS, RAMP LENGTH AND ANGLE SHOULD NOT EXCEED THREE METRES AND 20 DEGREES, RESPECTIVELY.

IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE EVALUATED THE PHYSIOLOGICAL, METABOLIC AND BIOCHEMICAL CONSEQUENCES OF BOTH AQUATIC HYPOXIA AND EMERSION IN INANGA.

WE EXAMINED SPATIAL PATTERNS OF GENETIC AND PHENOTYPIC VARIABILITY AMONG GALAXIAS MACULATUS POPULATIONS IN A COMPLEX OF FOUR POSTGLACIAL LAKES IN NORTHWESTERN PATAGONIA DIFFERING IN SIZE AND CONNECTIVITY AMONG THEM. A HIERARCHICAL BAYESIAN ANALYSIS GROUPED THE INDIVIDUALS COLLECTED FROM ELEVEN LOCALITIES INTO THREE GENETIC CLUSTERS, FIRST DEFINING THE POPULATIONS OF THE TWO LARGE LAKES AND SEPARATING THE TWO SMALL LAKES IN SUBSEQUENT ANALYSIS. GENETIC STRUCTURING WAS RESTRICTED WITHIN LARGE LAKES. IT IS KNOWN THAT THE LARVAL STAGE OF GALAXIAS MACULATUS MIGRATE TO THE LIMNETIC ZONE OF PATAGONIAN LAKES, POSSIBLY EXERTING AN HOMOGENIZING EFFECT ON GENE FLOW WITHIN LAKES. GENE FLOW ASYMMETRY AND DIVERGENCES AMONG LAKES CAN BE EXPLAINED BY A COMBINATION OF LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS AND THE PRESENCE OF PREDATORS IN THE SHORT STREAMS THAT CONNECT THEM. INDIVIDUALS FROM THE SMALL LAKES ARE THE MOST DIVERGENT MORPHOLOGICALLY AND GENETICALLY. THE POPULATION IN THE ISOLATED REDONDA LAKE, EXHIBITS MERISTIC DIFFERENCES AS WELL, SUGGESTING STRONG DRIFT AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS.

MOREOVER, LIMITED RESEARCH HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT EXPLORING ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES FOR MACROPHYTE REMOVAL THAT MINIMISE THE IMPACT ON THE RESIDENT FISH COMMUNITY. THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY WERE (I) TO DETERMINE HOW THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF REMOVING ALMOST 100\% OF AVAILABLE MACROPHYTE COVER AFFECTS NATIVE FISH POPULATIONS IN LOWLAND NEW ZEALAND STREAMS AND (II) TO SEE WHETHER THIS IMPACT CAN BE REDUCED BY LIMITING MACROPHYTE REMOVAL TO ALTERNATING 50-M SECTIONS OF THE WATERWAY. NATIVE FISH POPULATIONS WERE SURVEYED BEFORE AND AFTER EXPERIMENTAL MACROPHYTE REMOVAL FOR THE FOLLOWING THREE TREATMENTS: (I) COMPLETE MACROPHYTE REMOVAL, (II) MACROPHYTE REMOVAL FROM ALTERNATING 50-M REACHES AND (III) CONTROL WITH NO MACROPHYTE REMOVAL. RADIOTELEMETRY WAS USED TO MONITOR THE BEHAVIOURAL RESPONSE OF INDIVIDUAL GIANT KOKOPU (GALAXIAS ARGENTEUS) TO THE DIFFERENT TREATMENTS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT CURRENT DRAIN MANAGEMENT PRACTICES REDUCE CPUE OF FISH BY 60\%. ALTHOUGH LIMITING MACROPHYTE REMOVAL TO ALTERNATING 50-M SECTIONS DID NOT MINIMISE THE COMMUNITY IMPACTS OF DRAIN CLEARING, LARGE GIANT KOKOPU DID BENEFIT FROM THIS STRATEGY. ALL TAGGED GIANT KOKOPU REMAINED IN STREAM REACHES PARTIALLY CLEARED OF MACROPHYTES, WHILE IN COMPLETELY CLEARED REACHES ALL INDIVIDUALS WERE DISPLACED. THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE THREAT CURRENT DRAIN MANAGEMENT PRACTICES POSE TO NEW ZEALAND NATIVE FISH AND HIGHLIGHT THE VALUE OF TRIALLING ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF MACROPHYTE REMOVAL.","ALABASTER JS, 1982, WATER QUALITY CRITER; ALDRIDGE DC, 2000, BIOL CONSERV, V95, P247, DOI 10.1016/S0006-3207(00)00045-8; ALLIBONE R, 2010, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V44, P271, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2010.514346; ARMITAGE PD, 1994, AQUAT CONSERV, V4, P95, DOI 10.1002/AQC.3270040202; BROOKES A., 1988, CHANNELIZED RIVERS P; BRUTON MN, 1985, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V125, P221, DOI 10.1007/BF00045937; DAVID BO, 2003, FRESHWATER BIOL, V48, P1765, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-2427.2003.01127.X; DAVID BO, 2001, J FISH BIOL, V59, P705, DOI 10.1006/JFBI.2001.1684; DAWSON F H, 1991, AQUACULTURE AND FISHERIES MANAGEMENT, V22, P113, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2109.1991.TB00500.X; FOX AM., 1992, RIVERS HDB, P216; GARNER P, 1996, AQUAT CONSERV, V6, P21, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-0755(199603)6:1<21::AID-AQC171>3.0.CO;2-Z; GOLDSMITH R.

IN MANY MARINE AND FRESHWATER BENTHIC FISH, MIGRATION INTO A PELAGIC ENVIRONMENT BY DEVELOPING LARVAE IS A COMMON LIFE HISTORY TRAIT THAT COULD REDUCE EXPOSURE TO PARASITES DURING A CRITICAL WINDOW OF DEVELOPMENTAL SUSCEPTIBILITY. WE TESTED THIS HYPOTHESIS ON CONGENERIC FISH (FAMILY GALAXIIDAE, GENUS GALAXIAS) BELONGING TO A CLOSELY RELATED SPECIES COMPLEX SAMPLED FROM COASTAL STREAMS IN SOUTHEASTERN NEW ZEALAND. MIGRATORY GALAXIAS HAVE LARVAE THAT MIGRATE TO PELAGIC MARINE ENVIRONMENTS, WHEREAS THE LARVAE OF NON-MIGRATORY SPECIES REAR CLOSE TO ADULT HABITATS WITH NO PELAGIC LARVAL PHASE. BOTH MIGRATORY AND NON-MIGRATORY FISH ARE HOSTS TO TWO SPECIES OF SKIN-PENETRATING TREMATODES THAT CAUSE SPINAL MALFORMATIONS AND HIGH MORTALITY IN YOUNG FISH. USING GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS WITHIN AN AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION AND MODEL AVERAGING FRAMEWORK, WE COMPARED INFECTION LEVELS BETWEEN MIGRATORY AND NON-MIGRATORY FISH WHILE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BODY SIZE AND SEVERAL OTHER LOCAL FACTORS LIKELY TO INFLUENCE INFECTION LEVELS. FOR ONE TREMATODE SPECIES, WE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF MIGRATION: FOR ANY GIVEN BODY LENGTH, MIGRATORY FISH HARBOURED FEWER PARASITES THAN NON-MIGRATORY FISH. ALSO, NO PARASITES OF ANY KIND WERE FOUND IN JUVENILE MIGRATORY FISH SAMPLED IN SPRING SHORTLY AFTER THEIR RETURN TO STREAM HABITATS. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT MIGRATION SPARES JUVENILE FISH FROM THE DEBILITATING PARASITES TO WHICH THEY WOULD BE EXPOSED IN ADULT STREAM HABITATS. THEREFORE, EITHER THE HISTORICAL ADOPTION OF A MIGRATORY STRATEGY IN SOME GALAXIAS WAS AN ADAPTATION AGAINST PARASITISM, OR IT EVOLVED FOR OTHER REASONS AND NOW PROVIDES PROTECTION FROM INFECTION AS A COINCIDENTAL SIDE-EFFECT.","ALLIBONE RM, 1993, BIOL J LINN SOC, V50, P19, DOI 10.1006/BIJL.1993.1045; ALTIZER S, 2011, SCIENCE, V331, P296, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.1194694; BARTON K., 2009, MUMIN MULTIMODEL INF MUMIN MULTIMODEL INF MUMIN MULTIMODEL INF MUMIN MULTIMODEL INF MUMIN MULTI MODEL IN MUMIN MULTIMODEL INF MUMIN MULTIMODEL INF MUMIN MULTIMODEL INF MUMIN MULTIMODEL INF MUMIN MULTIMODEL INF MUMIN MULTI MODEL IN MUMIN MULTIMODEL INF MUMIN MULTIMODEL INF MUMIN MULTIMODEL INF MUMIN MULTI MODEL IN MUMIN MULTIMODEL INF MUMIN MULTIMODEL INF MUMIN MULTIMODEL INF MUMIN MULTI MODEL IN MUMIN MULTIMODEL INF MUMIN MULTIMODEL INF MUMIN MULTIMODEL INF; BOUILLON DR, 1987, J WILDLIFE DIS, V23, P502, DOI 10.7589/0090-3558-23.3.502; BOYLE WA, 2008, J ANIM ECOL, V77, P1122, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2656.2008.01451.X; BROOKS DR, 2007, TRENDS PARASITOL, V23, P571, DOI 10.1016/J.PT.2007.08.016; BURNHAM K.P., 2002, MODEL SELECTION MULT; DE ROIJ J, 2011, FUNCT ECOL, V25, P217, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2435.2010.01775.X; DINGLE H., 1996, MIGRATION BIOL LIFE; DINGLE H, 2007, BIOSCIENCE, V57, P113, DOI 10.1641/B570206; FERGUSON JA, 2011, INT J PARASITOL, V41, P1197, DOI 10.1016/J.IJPARA.2011.07.005; FOLSTAD I, 1991, CAN J ZOOL, V69, P2423, DOI 10.1139/Z91-340; FREDENSBORG BL, 2006, J ANIM ECOL, V75, P44, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2656.2005.01021.X; GORDON DM, 1982, PARASITOLOGY, V84, P41, DOI 10.1017/S0031182000051647; GROSS MR, 1988, SCIENCE, V239, P1291, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.239.4845.1291; GRUTTER AS, 2010, CORAL REEFS, V29, P31, DOI 10.1007/S00338-009-0561-1; HERRMANN KK, 2011, PARASITOLOGY, V138, P1183, DOI 10.1017/S0031182011000783; HINE PM, 2000, NIWA TECH REP, V75, P1; JACOBSON KC, 2008, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V354, P235, DOI 10.3354/MEPS07232; KELLY DW, 2009, FRESHWATER BIOL, V54, P1805, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2427.2009.02228.X; KELLY DW, 2010, J ANIM ECOL, V79, P445, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2656.2009.01636.X; LAFFERTY KD, 2009, ECOLOGY, V90, P888, DOI 10.1890/08-0079.1; LEMLY AD, 1984, J PARASITOL, V70, P475, DOI 10.2307/3281395; LEVIN LA, 2006, INTEGR COMP BIOL, V46, P282, DOI 10.1093/ICB/ICJ024; LOEHLE C, 1995, ECOLOGY, V76, P326, DOI 10.2307/1941192; LUCAS M.C., 2001, MIGRATION FRESHWATER; MACFARIANE W.

THIS STUDY TESTED THE EFFICACY OF A FISH RAMP AND SPOILER BAFFLES FOR RESTORING INDIGENOUS FISH COMMUNITIES UPSTREAM OF A CULVERT. BEFOREAFTER MONITORING SHOWED THAT INSTALLATION OF THE RAMP AND SPOILER BAFFLES INCREASED SPECIES RICHNESS (MEAN INCREASE 80\%) AND TOTAL FISH DENSITY (MEAN INCREASE 45\%) UPSTREAM OF THE CULVERT. PASSAGE TRIALS ON THE RAMP AND BAFFLED CULVERT WERE CARRIED OUT USING INANGA, GALAXIAS MACULATUS (JENYNS), A COMMONLY OCCURRING WEAK-SWIMMING MIGRATORY FISH. THE TRIALS SHOWED THAT INANGA WERE CAPABLE OF SUCCESSFULLY ASCENDING BOTH THE RAMP (OVERALL 27.1\% SUCCESS) AND CULVERT WITH BAFFLES (OVERALL 6.2\% SUCCESS) UNDER THE CONDITIONS TESTED (CF. 0\% SUCCESS FOR THIS SPECIES BEFORE RETROFITTING), BUT PASSAGE EFFICIENCY WAS STILL RELATIVELY LOW IN BOTH CASES. RETROFITTING OF CULVERTS CAN THEREFORE BE EFFECTIVE FOR RESTORING UPSTREAM FISH PASSAGE. HOWEVER, TO MAXIMIZE EFFECTIVENESS IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT RESTORATION GOALS ARE WELL DEFINED AND RETROFITTING SOLUTIONS ARE DESIGNED APPROPRIATELY FOR THE TARGET SPECIES.

DIRECT ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS HAVE BEEN WIDELY DOCUMENTED, BUT INDIRECT GENETIC EFFECTS ON NATIVE SPECIES ARE POORLY KNOWN. IN MANY CASES, THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF INFORMATION ON THE GENETIC STRUCTURE OF SPECIES AFFECTED BY INVASIONS. 2. WE USED MICROSATELLITE DNA LOCI TO ESTIMATE THE GENETIC STRUCTURE AND GENE FLOW PATTERNS OF GALAXIAS MACULATUS, A GALAXIID FISH ENDEMIC TO THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE, WHICH IS INCREASINGLY BEING THREATENED BY SALMONID INVASIONS. 3. ANALYSIS OF NINE DIADROMOUS POPULATIONS OF G.SIMILAR TO MACULATUS IN CHILEAN PATAGONIA (AN AREA HEAVILY IMPACTED BY FARMING OF NON-NATIVE SALMONIDS) INDICATES THAT DISPERSAL IS MOSTLY A PASSIVE PROCESS, SEEMINGLY DRIVEN BY WIND AND CURRENTS AND RESULTING IN HIGH GENE FLOW AND WEAK POPULATION STRUCTURING. 4. GENE FLOW WAS ASYMMETRICAL, WITH THREE POPULATIONS ACTING AS SOURCES AND SIX POPULATIONS ACTING AS SINKS. SINKS HAD LOWER HABITAT QUALITY AND HAD A GREATER INCIDENCE OF ADULTS THAN SOURCES, WHICH CONSISTED MOSTLY OF JUVENILES. 5. RIVERS INVADED BY SALMONID ESCAPEES EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AQUACULTURE PRESSURE THAN RIVERS WHERE SALMONID ESCAPEES WERE APPARENTLY ABSENT, BUT NO EFFECT ON GENETIC DIVERSITY OF G.SIMILAR TO MACULATUS COULD BE DETECTED. 6. WE DISCUSS WHETHER SALMONID AQUACULTURE MIGHT AFFECT THE DEMOGRAPHY AND CONNECTIVITY OF GALAXIID METAPOPULATIONS: INDIRECTLY THROUGH HABITAT ALTERATION AND DIRECTLY THROUGH ESCAPES OF PREDATORY FISH.","ANDRE C, 2011, HEREDITY, V106, P270, DOI 10.1038/HDY.2010.71;

THIS GROUP HAS BEEN CENTRAL IN ARGUMENTS CONCERNING THE ROLES OF DISPERSAL AND VICARIANCE IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE, AS SOME TAXA HAVE MARINE LIFE HISTORY STAGES THROUGH WHICH TRANSOCEANIC DISPERSAL MAY HAVE BEEN FACILITATED, YET OTHER GALAXIIDS ARE ENTIRELY RESTRICTED TO FRESHWATERS. LOCATION SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE LAND MASSES OF GONDWANAN DERIVATION. METHODS BIOGEOGRAPHIC HYPOTHESES OF GONDWANAN VICARIANCE AND MARINE DISPERSAL WERE TESTED USING FOUR LINES OF EVIDENCE: (1) CONCORDANCE OF SPECIESAREA PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS, (2) MOLECULAR ESTIMATES OF LINEAGE DIVERGENCE TIMES WITH A PRIORI EXPECTATIONS BASED ON PLATE TECTONICS, (3) RECONSTRUCTIONS OF ANCESTRAL DISPERSAL CAPABILITIES, AND (4) RECONSTRUCTIONS OF DISTRIBUTION INHERITANCE SCENARIOS (USING THE DISPERSAL-EXTINCTION-CLADOGENESIS MODEL TO INFER HISTORICAL RANGES AND DISPERSAL AND EXTINCTION EVENTS). RESULTS PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS WERE RECONSTRUCTED FROM 4531 MITOCHONDRIAL AND NUCLEAR NUCLEOTIDE CHARACTERS, AND 181 MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS, ACROSS 53 OF THE 56 PRESENTLY RECOGNIZED SPECIES. PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS WERE GENERALLY WELL RESOLVED AND SUPPORTED AMONG GALAXIIDS USING THE COMBINED DATASET, AND CONFLICTING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MOLECULAR AND MORPHOLOGICAL DATASETS TYPICALLY RECEIVED LOW TOPOLOGICAL SUPPORT FROM EITHER OR BOTH DATASETS. TRANSOCEANIC DISJUNCTIONS WERE EXHIBITED AT 16 NODES, BUT ONLY THREE PRE-DATED RELEVANT CONTINENTAL FRAGMENTATION EVENTS; FURTHERMORE, ANCESTRAL DISTRIBUTION INHERITANCE SCENARIOS FOR TWO OF THESE NODES REFLECTED CLADOGENESIS WITHIN, RATHER THAN BETWEEN, GONDWANAN LAND MASSES, AND ANCESTRAL MARINE DISPERSAL CAPABILITY COULD NOT BE REJECTED FOR ALL THREE. INSTEAD, THE FOUR LINES OF EVIDENCE SURVEYED SUGGEST THAT GONDWANAN VICARIANCE OCCURRED TWICE, BUT IN BOTH INSTANCES WAS PRECEDED BY MARINE DISPERSAL BETWEEN LAND MASSES, AND IN AT LEAST ONE INSTANCE WAS INITIATED BY THE CESSATION OF MARINE DISPERSAL SUBSEQUENT TO CONTINENTAL FRAGMENTATION. MAIN CONCLUSIONS GONDWANAN VICARIANCE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN PRECEDED BY MARINE DISPERSAL IN THE FEW INSTANCES WHERE IT MAY EXPLAIN CONTEMPORARY GALAXIID DISTRIBUTION, SUCH THAT THESE BIOGEOGRAPHIC MECHANISMS MAY SOMETIMES HAVE A SYNERGISTIC RELATIONSHIP.","BANARESCU P., 1990, ZOOGEOGRAPHY FRESH W; BARKER PF, 2004, EARTH-SCI REV, V66, P143, DOI 10.1016/J.EARSCIREV.2003.10.003; BAUM DA, 1998, SYST BIOL, V47, P181, DOI 10.1080/106351598260879; BEU AG, 1997, TECTONOPHYSICS, V281, P83, DOI 10.1016/S0040-1951(97)00160-1; BOWEN BW, 1997, EVOLUTION, V51, P1601, DOI 10.1111/J.1558-5646.1997.TB01483.X; BRIGGS JC, 2003, SYST BIOL, V52, P548, DOI 10.1080/10635150390218385; BRIGGS JC, 1995, GLOBAL BIOGEOGRAPHY; BURRIDGE CP, 2006, EVOLUTION, V60, P1038; BURRIDGE CP, 2008, MOL BIOL EVOL, V25, P624, DOI 10.1093/MOLBEV/MSM271; BURRIDGE CP, 2006, SYST BIOL, V55, P566, DOI 10.1080/10635150600812585; BURRIDGE CP, 1999, MOL PHYLOGENET EVOL, V13, P93, DOI 10.1006/MPEV.1999.0622; CAMPBELL HJ, 2006, GEOLOGICAL SOC NZ MI, V121, P9; CAMPOS H, 1984, EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY, P113; CHOW S, 1998, MOL ECOL, V7, P1255; COOPER A, 1992, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V89, P8741, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.89.18.8741; CRAW D, 2003, NATURAL HIST SO NZ, P17; CRAW RC, 1979, SYST ZOOL, V28, P99, DOI 10.2307/2413006; CROIZAT L, 1974, SYST ZOOL, V23, P265, DOI 10.2307/2412139; DARLINGTON P.

COMMON SMELT (RETROPINNA RETROPINNA) WAS THE DOMINANT PREY ITEM OF RAINBOW TROUT LARGER THAN 200 MM (77.8\% OF DIET BY WEIGHT), FOLLOWED BY KOURA (FRESHWATER CRAYFISH PARANEPHROPS PLANIFRONS; 6.3\%), COMMON BULLY (GOBIOMORPHUS COTIDIANUS; 5.5\%), AND KOARO (GALAXIAS BREVIPINNIS; 3.4\%). JUVENILE RAINBOW TROUT (<200 MM) CONSUMED AMPHIPODS, AQUATIC AND TERRESTRIAL INSECTS, OLIGOCHAETES, TANAID SHRIMPS, AND SMELT. TROUT CONSUMED KOARO ONLY IN AUTUMN AND WINTER; CONSUMPTION OF OTHER SPECIES DID NOT VARY SEASONALLY. THE MAXIMUM SIZE OF SMELT CONSUMED INCREASED WITH INCREASING TROUT SIZE, BUT TROUT CONTINUED TO CONSUME SMALL SMELT EVEN AS LARGE ADULTS.

BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF YOLK ALLOCATED TO EGGS IS FINITE, NOT ALL FITNESS-DETERMINING TRAITS CAN BE SIMULTANEOUSLY MAXIMISED, AND TRADE-OFFS SHOULD BE EXPECTED. THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY SHOW THAT EGG SIZE (QUANTIFIED AS CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA) POORLY PREDICTS THE SIZE OF LARVAL MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS (LENGTH, YOLK SAC AREA, OIL GLOBULE AREA, MYOMERE DEPTH, AND EYE AREA) IN THE NATIVE AUSTRALIAN FISH GALAXIAS MACULATUS. EGG SIZE WAS CORRELATED WITH YOLK SAC SIZE AND LARVAL BODY DEPTH, BUT IT EXPLAINED <13\% OF THE TOTAL VARIATION IN THESE TRAITS. MOREOVER, EGG SIZE DID NOT PREDICT THE TIME IT TOOK FOR LARVAE TO HATCH, NOR DID IT PREDICT THE DURATION FROM HATCHING TO STARVATION. HOWEVER, WHEN EGG SIZE AND YOLK SAC SIZE (I.E. YOLK REMAINING AT HATCHING) WERE BOTH INCLUDED AS PREDICTORS, THE FITS WITH LARVAL TRAITS IMPROVED GREATLY (R(2) = 0.02 TO 0.46 FOR LARVAL LENGTH, R(2) = 0.11 TO 0.17 FOR MYOMERE DEPTH, AND R(2) < 0.001 TO 0.14 FOR EYE AREA). THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THERE IS A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN THE QUANTITY OF YOLK AT HATCHING AND THE SIZE OF LARVAL MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS IN G. MACULATUS. THE REMAINING UNEXPLAINED VARIATION MAY BE A CONSEQUENCE OF TRADE-OFFS WITH OTHER UNMEASURED TRAITS, SUCH AS METABOLIC RATE, AND THE POTENTIAL THAT EGG SIZE IS NOT A GOOD PROXY FOR MATERNAL INVESTMENT.","ALLEN JD, 2008, BIOL BULL-US, V214, P42, DOI 10.2307/25066658; BAILEY KM, 1989, ADV MAR BIOL, V25, P1; BANG A, 2005, MAR BIOL, V147, P1419, DOI 10.1007/S00227-005-0037-Y; BANG A, 2004, J FISH BIOL, V64, P1285, DOI 10.1111/J.0022-1112.2004.00391.X; BANG A, 2007, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V331, P233, DOI 10.3354/MEPS331233; BARBEE NC, 2011, MAR FRESHWATER RES, V62, P790, DOI 10.1071/MF10284; BENZIE V., 1968, PROCEEDINGS OF THE NEW ZEALAND ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY, VNO. 15, P31; BENZIE V, 1968, NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH, V2, P606; BERNARDO J, 1996, AM ZOOL, V36, P216; BERRA TM, 1996, MAR FRESHWATER RES, V47, P845, DOI 10.1071/MF9960845; BOCHDANSKY AB, 2005, MAR BIOL, V147, P1413, DOI 10.1007/S00227-005-0036-Z; CHAMBERS R.

TO CREATIVELY SOLVE PART OF THIS PROBLEM, WE ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MUSSEL SPAT ROPES FOR IMPROVING FISH PASSAGE PAST PERCHED CULVERT STRUCTURES. WE USED A BEFORE-AFTER-CONTROL-TREATMENT DESIGN TO TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS THAT RELATIVE ABUNDANCES OF `YOUNG-OF-THE-YEAR' MIGRATORY FISH SPECIES WOULD INCREASE FOLLOWING ROPE INSTALLATION IN A NEW ZEALAND STREAM. RESULTS FOLLOWING REMEDIATION INDICATED A SIGNIFICANT THREE-TO FOUR-FOLD INCREASE IN FISH ABUNDANCE RELATIVE TO A CONTROL STREAM. ALTHOUGH FOUR SPECIES (BANDED KOKOPU (GALAXIAS FASCIATUS), REDFIN BULLIES (GOBIOMORPHUS HUTTONI), LONGFIN EELS (ANGUILLA DIEFFENBACHII) AND SHORTFIN EELS (ANGUILLA AUSTRALIS)) WERE PRESENT AT BOTH THE TREATMENT AND CONTROL STREAM SITES, THE INCREASED FISH RELATIVE ABUNDANCE AT THE TREATMENT SITE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY AN INCREASE IN `YOUNG-OF-THE-YEAR' BANDED KOKOPU. THE PRESENT STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT MUSSEL SPAT ROPES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE FISH RELATIVE ABUNDANCES ABOVE SEVERELY PERCHED CULVERTS, BUT MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL SPECIES PRESENT.

IN NEW ZEALAND, SUCH IMPACTS HAVE CAUSED CHANGES IN NATIVE VEGETATION, ENHANCED INVASION BY EXOTIC GRASSES, AND ALTERED RIVER BANK MORPHOLOGY. ONE CONSEQUENCE HAS BEEN A GREAT REDUCTION IN OBLIGATE SPAWNING HABITAT OF A DIADROMOUS FISH, GALAXIAS MACULATUS. JUVENILE G. MACULATUS COMPRISE A CULTURALLY IMPORTANT FISHERY THAT HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLY REDUCED OVER RECENT DECADES. REHABILITATION OF RIPARIAN VEGETATION NEEDED FOR SPAWNING IS RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD, BUT SLOW. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT ARTIFICIAL SPAWNING HABITATS COULD ACCELERATE RESTORATION OF FISH EGG PRODUCTION BY CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT THAT WOULD SUPPORT AT LEAST THE SAME DENSITY AND SURVIVAL OF EGGS AS NON-IMPACTED VEGETATION. WE TESTED THREE ARTIFICIAL DEVICES (STRAW BALES, STRAW TUBES, AND MOSS TUBES) IN DEGRADED AND INTACT SITES. EGGS WERE LAID IN ALL OF THESE WITH NUMBERS AND SURVIVAL USUALLY EXCEEDING THAT IN RIPARIAN GRASSES. WHERE HABITAT WAS DEGRADED, ARTIFICIAL SPAWNING HABITATS YIELDED UP TO 10,000 EGGS COMPARED TO NONE IN NEARBY NATURAL SPAWNING HABITAT. THE GROUND-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT OF ARTIFICIAL HABITAT WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF INTACT VEGETATION IN BUFFERING AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY FLUCTUATIONS. CRUCIAL PROPERTIES OF THE ARTIFICIAL HABITATS WERE (1) SHELTER TO PROVIDE SHADE AND HOLD MOISTURE; (2) ACCESSIBILITY TO ALLOW ADULT FISH TO DEPOSIT AND FERTILIZE EGGS; AND (3) ROBUSTNESS TO PROVIDE RELIABLE SURFACES AND PROTECTION FOR THE EGGS DURING THEIR DEVELOPMENT. WE SHOW THAT ARTIFICIAL SPAWNING HABITATS ARE A VIABLE SHORT-TERM ALTERNATIVE TO REHABILITATING SPAWNING HABITAT WHILE LEGACY EFFECTS ABATE AND RIPARIAN VEGETATION RECOVERS.","BULLOCK JM, 1994, J ECOL, V82, P331, DOI 10.2307/2261301; CLARY WP, 2002, WETLANDS, V22, P139, DOI 10.1672/0277-5212(2002)0220139:SAVRTS2.0.CO;2; FITCH L, 1998, CAN J PLANT SCI, V78, P191, DOI 10.4141/P97-141; FRISSELL C A, 1992, NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT, V12, P182, DOI 10.1577/1548-8675(1992)012<0182:IACOPF>2.3.CO;2; HICKFORD MJH, 2011, PLOS ONE, V6, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0024318; HICKFORD MJH, 2011, OECOLOGIA, V166, P131, DOI 10.1007/S00442-010-1834-7; HICKFORD MJH, 2010, J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL, V385, P66, DOI 10.1016/J.JEMBE.2010.01.010; HICKS A, 2010, MAR FRESHWATER RES, V61, P1252, DOI 10.1071/MF10011; KOSKI K.V., 1992, P343; LARNED ST, 2004, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V38, P347, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2004.9517243; MACLEOD CJ, 2006, AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON, V115, P201, DOI 10.1016/J.AGEE.2006.01.003; MALONEY KO, 2008, J N AM BENTHOL SOC, V27, P280, DOI 10.1899/07-070.1; MCDOWALL RM, 1990, NZ FRESHWATER FISHES; MCDOWALL RM, 1980, FISHERIES RES B, V20, P1; MEADE RH, 1982, J GEOL, V90, P235, DOI 10.1086/628677; MITCHELL CP, 1994, SCI RES SERIES, V69; MURPHY ML, 1995, NOAA COASTAL OCEAN P, V7; RONI P, 2002, N AM J FISH MANAGE, V22, P1, DOI 10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022\&LT;0001:AROSRT\&GT;2.0.CO;2; RONI P., 2005, GLOBAL REV EFFECTIVE; SARR DA, 2002, ENVIRON MANAGE, V30, P516, DOI 10.1007/S00267-002-2608-8; TAYLOR MJ, 2002, SCI CONSERVATION SER, V188; WOOTTON RJ., 1998, ECOLOGY TELEOST FISH",10.1111/REC.12008,5,NEW ZEALAND;NEW ZEALAND,105,TERTIARY,UOC,NZ,CANTERBURY,N,Y,N,N,N,N,REGIONAL,41,N,NA,NA,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,NA,HABITAT MANIPULATION,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N

THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL OXYGEN TENSION ON OXYGEN CONSUMPTION AS A FUNCTION OF BODY MASS IN THE GALAXIID FISH, INANGA (GALAXIAS MACULATUS). AS AN OXYCONFORMER, THIS FISH LACKS OVERT INTRINSIC REGULATION OF OXYGEN CONSUMPTION, ELIMINATING THIS AS A FACTOR AFFECTING THE SCALING RELATIONSHIP AT DIFFERENT OXYGEN TENSIONS. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OXYGEN CONSUMPTION RATE AND BODY SIZE WAS BEST DESCRIBED BY A POWER FUNCTION, WITH AN EXPONENT OF 0.82, HIGHER THAN THE THEORETICAL VALUES OF 0.66 OR 0.75. THE VALUE OF THIS EXPONENT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED BY ENVIRONMENTAL PO-2, FIRST INCREASING AS PO-2 DECREASED AND THEN DECLINING AT THE LOWEST PO-2 TESTED. THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT THE SCALING EXPONENT IS SPECIES SPECIFIC AND REGULATED BY EXTRINSIC FACTORS. FURTHERMORE, THE EXTERNAL PO-2 AT WHICH FISH LOST EQUILIBRIUM WAS RELATED TO FISH SIZE, AN EFFECT EXPLAINED BY THE SCALING OF ANAEROBIC CAPACITY WITH FISH MASS. THEREFORE, ALTHOUGH BIGGER FISH WERE FORCED TO DEPRESS AEROBIC METABOLISM MORE RAPIDLY THAN SMALL FISH WHEN EXPOSED TO PROGRESSIVE HYPOXIA, THEY WERE BETTER ABLE TO ENACT ANAEROBIC METABOLISM, POTENTIALLY EXTENDING THEIR SURVIVAL IN HYPOXIA.","AGUTTER PS, 2011, J EXP BIOL, V214, P1055, DOI 10.1242/JEB.054502; ALMEIDA-VAL VMF, 2000, COMP BIOCHEM PHYS B, V125, P219, DOI 10.1016/S0305-0491(99)00172-8; ATKINSON HJ, 1973, J EXP BIOL, V59, P255; BANGERT RK, 2008, HEREDITY, V100, P121, DOI 10.1038/SJ.HDY.6800914; BOKMA F, 2004, FUNCT ECOL, V18, P184, DOI 10.1111/J.0269-8463.2004.00817.X; BOUTILIER RG, 2001, J EXP BIOL, V204, P3171; BRETT J.R., 1979, FISH PHYSIOL, V8, P279, DOI DOI 10.1016/S1546-5098(08)60029-1; BURLESON ML, 2001, J FISH BIOL, V59, P1336, DOI 10.1006/JFBI.2001.1745; CEREZO J, 2004, J APPL ICHTHYOL, V20, P488, DOI 10.1111/J.1439-0426.2004.00601.X; CLARKE A, 1999, J ANIM ECOL, V68, P893, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-2656.1999.00337.X; DARVEAU CA, 2002, NATURE, V417, P166, DOI 10.1038/417166A; DEAN TL, 1999, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V33, P99, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1999.9516860; ENCINA-MONTOYA F, 2011, AQUAC RES, V42, P835, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2109.2010.02692.X; EVERETT MV, 2010, PHYSIOL BIOCHEM ZOOL, V83, P182, DOI 10.1086/648482; FULTON W., 2000, FISH MOVEMENT MIGRAT, P256; GLAZIER DS, 2005, BIOL REV, V80, P611, DOI 10.1017/S1464793105006834; GOOLISH EDWARD M., 1995, BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF FISHES, V4, P335; HOCHACHKA PW, 1986, SCIENCE, V231, P234, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.2417316; HOCHACHKA PW, 2003, COMP BIOCHEM PHYS A, V134, P675, DOI 10.1016/S1095-6433(02)00364-1; JOBLING M., 1994, FISH BIOENERGETICS, P121; KILLEN SS, 2010, ECOL LETT, V13, P184, DOI 10.1111/J.1461-0248.2009.01415.X; LARDIES MA, 2004, CAN J ZOOL, V82, P677, DOI 10.1139/Z04-033; MARDONES A, 2008, AQUAC RES, V39, P731, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2109.2008.01925.X; MCDOWALL R.M., 1968, NZ MARINE DEP FISHER, V2, P1; MCDOWALL RM, 2000, J BIOGEOGR, V27, P1221, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-2699.2000.00490.X; MCDOWALL RM, 1990, NZ FRESHWATER FISHES; MCDOWELL RW, 2008, NEW ZEAL VET J, V56, P289, DOI 10.1080/00480169.2008.36849; NAGY KA, 2005, J EXP BIOL, V208, P1621, DOI 10.1242/JEB.01553; NILSSON GE, 2004, P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI, V271, PS30, DOI 10.1098/RSBL.2003.0087; NILSSON GE, 2008, BIOL REV, V83, P173, DOI 10.1111/J.1469-185X.2008.00038.X; PETERS R.H., 1983, P1; PROSSER C.L., 1973, COMP ANIMAL PHYSL; R DEVELOPMENT CORE TEAM, 2010, R LANG ENV STAT COMP; RANDALL DJ, 2011, ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FISH PHYSIOLOGY: FROM GENOME TO ENVIRONMENT, VOLS 1-3, P909; ROBB T, 2003, J FISH BIOL, V62, P1067, DOI 10.1046/J.1095-8649.2003.00097.X; SLOMAN KA, 2006, J EXP BIOL, V209, P1197, DOI 10.1242/JEB.02090; SOKAL RR., 1995, BIOMETRY; SUAREZ RK, 2005, J EXP BIOL, V208, P1627, DOI 10.1242/JEB.01503; TRAN-DUY A, 2012, AQUAC RES, V43, P730, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2109.2011.02882.X; URBINA MA, 2012, J COMP PHYSIOL B, V182, P1057, DOI 10.1007/S00360-012-0678-3; URBINA MA, 2012, COMP BIOCHEM PHYS A, V161, P301, DOI 10.1016/J.CBPA.2011.11.011; URBINA MA, 2011, PHYSIOL BEHAV, V103, P240, DOI 10.1016/J.PHYSBEH.2011.02.009; VERBERK WCEP, 2011, PLOS ONE, V6, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0022610; WEST GB, 1997, SCIENCE, V276, P122, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.276.5309.122; WHITE CR, 2003, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V100, P4046, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.0436428100; WHITE CR, 2006, BIOL LETTERS, V2, P125, DOI 10.1098/RSBL.2005.0378; WHITE CR, 2012, P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI, V279, P1740, DOI 10.1098/RSPB.2011.2060; WINBERG G.G., 1960, TRANSLATION SERIES R, V194",10.1086/673727,23,NEW ZEALAND;NEW ZEALAND,110,TERTIARY,UOC,NZ,CANTERBURY,N,Y,N,N,N,N,LAB,NA,N,NA,NA,N,NA,Y,N,Y,N,NA,RESPIROMETRY,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N

THE STUDY PRESENTS INFORMATION ON MUSCLE GROWTH IN G.MACULATUS AS WELL AS THE RESULTS OF AN EXPERIMENT EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF FASTING ON THE GROWTH RATE, TOTAL MUSCLE GROWTH AND ENERGY DENSITY IN THIS SPECIES UNDER SUMMER-LIKE CONDITIONS. A UNIFORM PATTERN OF MUSCLE FIBRES SUGGESTS THE ABSENCE OF MOSAIC HYPERPLASTIC GROWTH IN G.MACULATUS. HYPERPLASIC GROWTH WAS COMPLETED BEFORE PUYEN REACHED 65MM TOTAL LENGTH, AND HYPERPLASIA CESSATION WAS CORRELATED TO THE TRANSITION FROM THE JUVENILE TO THE ADULT STAGE. IN THE EXPERIMENTAL FISH, WHERE HYPERTROPHIC GROWTH WAS THE UNIQUE PROCESS RESPONSIBLE FOR ADULT MUSCLE GROWTH, FASTING DECREASED MASS, CONDITION AND ENERGY DENSITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS, AND STOPPED HYPERTROPHIC GROWTH. THESE RESULTS ARE PROOF THAT REDUCED FOOD CONSUMPTION IN SOUTHERLY PUYEN POPULATIONS DURING WINTER MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO THE SEASONALITY OF THE GROWTH PREVIOUSLY REPORTED FOR THIS SPECIES. A PROVISIONAL SUMMER GROWTH RATE OF 2-3MM/MONTH IS SUGGESTED FOR POPULATIONS INHABITING THE SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THIS SPECIES' DISTRIBUTION. G.MACULATUS IS THUS PROPOSED AS A USEFUL MODEL SPECIES TO STUDY HYPERTROPHIC MUSCLE GROWTH.","ABDEL I., 2004, SPEC PUBL EUR AQUAC, V34, P91; ALTRINGHAM JD, 1988, J EXP BIOL, V140, P313; ARENDT JD, 1997, Q REV BIOL, V72, P149, DOI 10.1086/419764; BARRIGA JP, 2007, J APPL ICHTHYOL, V23, P128, DOI 10.1111/J.1439-0426.2006.00820.X; BOY CC, 2007, J APPL ICHTHYOL, V23, P547, DOI 10.1111/J.1439-0426.2007.00842.X; BOY CC, 2009, J APPL ICHTHYOL, V25, P661, DOI 10.1111/J.1439-0426.2009.01309.X; BOY CC, 2009, POLAR BIOL, V32, P9, DOI 10.1007/S00300-008-0495-Z; CALVO J, 2008, INTERCIENCIA, V33, P223; CHAPMAN A, 2006, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V77, P21, DOI 10.1007/S10641-006-9051-2; FERRIZ A, 1987, R MUS ARG CIENC NAT, V6, P29; JOHNSTON I.

TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF THE LOSS OF WOOD FROM WATERWAYS, A FIELD TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED IN THREE SMALL FORESTED STREAMS IN NEW ZEALAND. THE OBJECTIVES WERE TO (I) EXAMINE DIFFERENCES IN FISH ASSEMBLAGES AMONG WOODED POOLS (WHERE WOOD PROVIDED COVER), OPEN POOLS AND RIFFLES AND (II) MEASURE THE EFFECTS OF WOOD REMOVAL ON CHANNEL MORPHOLOGY AND FISH ASSEMBLAGES. IN THE FIRST PART OF THE STUDY, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN TOTAL FISH DENSITY AMONG THE THREE HABITATS. HOWEVER, TOTAL FISH BIOMASS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN WOODED POOLS (64\% OF TOTAL FISH BIOMASS) COMPARED WITH OPEN POOLS AND RIFFLES. MEAN DENSITY AND BIOMASS OF BANDED KOKOPU (GALAXIAS FASCIATUS) AND MEAN BIOMASS OF LONGFIN EEL (ANGUILLA DIEFFENBACHII) WERE HIGHEST IN WOODED POOLS, WHEREAS THE DENSITY AND BIOMASS OF BLUEGILL BULLY (GOBIOMORPHUS HUBBSI) AND TORRENTFISH (CHEIMARRICHTHYS FOSTERI) WERE HIGHEST IN RIFFLES. IN THE SECOND PART OF THE STUDY, WOOD WAS REMOVED FROM A 200-M SECTION (TREATMENT) IN EACH STREAM, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING POOL AREA AND INCREASING THE PROPORTION OF CHANNEL AREA AND LENGTH IN RIFFLES. AT THE HABITAT SCALE, BANDED KOKOPU AND LARGE LONGFIN EEL WERE THE TWO SPECIES MOSTLY AFFECTED BY WOOD REMOVAL. AT THE REACH SCALE, BANDED KOKOPU BIOMASS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE TREATMENT SECTIONS. ALTHOUGH WOODED POOLS WERE A SMALL PORTION OF TOTAL HABITAT, THEY PROVIDED IMPORTANT HABITAT FOR TWO OF NEW ZEALAND'S LARGER NATIVE FISH TAXA.","ANDERSON N H, 1982, MAURI ORA, V10, P21; ANGERMEIER PL, 1984, T AM FISH SOC, V113, P716, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(1984)113<716:RBWDAF>2.0.CO;2; ANTON A, 2011, ECOL FRESHW FISH, V20, P461, DOI 10.1111/J.1600-0633.2010.00482.X; BAILLIE BR, 2008, FOREST ECOL MANAG, V256, P20, DOI 10.1016/J.FORECO.2008.01.051; BAKER CF, 2007, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V41, P25, DOI 10.1080/00288330709509893; BENKE AC, 2003, AM FISH S S, V37, P149; BILBY RE, 1981, ECOLOGY, V62, P1234, DOI 10.2307/1937288; BILBY RE, 1984, J FOREST, V82, P609; BOND NR, 2005, RESTOR ECOL, V13, P39, DOI 10.1111/J.1526-100X.2005.00006.X; BRAATEN PJ, 1997, J FRESHWATER ECOL, V12, P477, DOI 10.1080/02705060.1997.9663558; CHADDERTON WL, 2000, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V34, P487, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2000.9516951; CROW SK, 2010, FRESHWATER BIOL, V55, P967, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2427.2009.02330.X; DIEZ JR, 2000, J N AM BENTHOL SOC, V19, P621, DOI 10.2307/1468121; DOLLOFF CA, 1986, T AM FISH SOC, V115, P743, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(1986)115<743:EOSCOJ>2.0.CO;2; DOLLOFF CA, 2003, AM FISH S S, V37, P179; DOOLE GJ, 2005, AUST J AGR RESOUR EC, V49, P395, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-8489.2005.00310.X; DUNCAN M, 2004, FRESHWATERS NZ; FAUSCH KD, 1992, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V49, P682, DOI 10.1139/F92-077; FELTMATE BW, 1991, ECOLOGY, V72, P1800, DOI 10.2307/1940979; GLOVA GJ, 1998, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V32, P255, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1998.9516824; GORDON ND., 1992, STREAM HYDROLOGY INT; GREENBERG LA, 1991, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V31, P389, DOI 10.1007/BF00002364; HARDING J., 2004, FRESHWATERS NZ; HARMON M.E., 1996, GUIDELINES MEASUREME; HARTMAN G.F., 2004, P271; HAWKINS CP, 1993, FISHERIES, V18, P3, DOI 10.1577/1548-8446(1993)018<0003:AHATCS>2.0.CO;2; HEWITT A.E., 1998, LANDCARE RES SCI SER, V1; HICKS B.J., 2004, P654, DOI 10.1002/9780470995242.CH29; HICKS B.J., 1991, AM FISH SOC SPEC PUB, V19; HOUSE R.

MOREOVER, WE SHOWED THAT G. MACULATUS IS OBSERVED IN THE LITTORAL ZONE DURING THE DAY, DISAPPEARS COMPLETELY FROM THIS ZONE AFTER SUNSET AND RETURNS AT SUNRISE. LITTORAL PREY SPECIES ARE COMMON IN THE DIET OF G.

THESE BEHAVIOURAL RHYTHMS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR G. MACULATUS, WHICH RUNS A HIGH PREDATION RISK WHEN CONSUMING PREY THAT IS WIDELY AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE LITTORAL ZONE. THIS RISK IS AMELIORATED UNDER THE PROTECTION OF LOW LIGHT INTENSITY. THUS, G.

AMONG A TOTAL OF 23 BIOPSY EVENTS, A SINGLE DEATH OCCURRED WHEN A TWO-LAYERED SUTURING APPROACH WAS USED, HIGHLIGHTING THE VALUE OF THIS METHOD FOR STUDY OF THE REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF VALUABLE FISH. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: THIS BIOPSY METHOD MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR VETERINARY RESEARCH ON FISH PHYSIOLOGY, PATHOLOGY, CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT, WHEN REPEATED TISSUE SAMPLES NEED TO BE COLLECTED OVER A PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME OR FOR GENERAL SURGICAL MANIPULATIONS ON FISH WHEN ACCESSING THE COELOM. FURTHERMORE, THIS APPROACH ALLOWS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A MORE POWERFUL EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, AS REPEATED MEASURES REDUCES THE VARIABILITY OF ESTIMATES DUE TO THE REMOVAL OF INHERENT STAGE DIFFERENCES AMONG INDIVIDUALS.","ALAM MA, 2008, AQUACULT INT, V16, P27, DOI 10.1007/S10499-007-9120-3; ALLIBONE R, 2010, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V44, P271, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2010.514346; AMIRI BM, 1999, FISH PHYSIOL BIOCHEM, V21, P1, DOI 10.1023/A:1007706128184; BARTON B.A., 1991, ANNUAL REVIEW OF FISH DISEASES, V1, P3, DOI 10.1016/0959-8030(91)90019-G; BLYTHE B, 1994, AQUACULTURE, V125, P175, DOI 10.1016/0044-8486(94)90294-1; CANDRL JS, 2010, N AM J AQUACULT, V72, P184, DOI 10.1577/A09-006.1; CHAPMAN FA, 2005, N AM J AQUACULT, V67, P98, DOI 10.1577/A04-046.1; COWARD K, 2001, AQUACULTURE, V195, P183, DOI 10.1016/S0044-8486(00)00544-5; DAVID BO, 2001, J FISH BIOL, V59, P705, DOI 10.1006/JFBI.2001.1684; DETERS KA, 2010, T AM FISH SOC, V139, P888, DOI 10.1577/T09-043.1; DEVLAMING V, 1982, COMP BIOCHEM PHYS A, V73, P31, DOI 10.1016/0300-9629(82)90088-3; EVANS AF, 2004, N AM J FISH MANAGE, V24, P967, DOI 10.1577/M03-112.1; FOSSUM T.W., 2007, SMALL ANIMAL SURG, P57; GILLILAND ER, 1994, PROG FISH CULT, V56, P60, DOI 10.1577/1548-8640(1994)056\&LT;0060:COASUI\&GT;2.3.CO;2; GUO S, 2010, J DENT RES, V89, P219, DOI 10.1177/0022034509359125; HARMS CA, 2005, LAB ANIMAL, V34, P28, DOI 10.1038/LABAN0105-28; HURTY CA, 2002, VET REC, V151, P324, DOI 10.1136/VR.151.11.324; LOKMAN PM, 1998, J FISH BIOL, V52, P547, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8649.1998.TB02016.X; MACPHERSON N, 2010, AUSTRALAS J DERMATOL, V51, P263, DOI 10.1111/J.1440-0960.2010.00691.X; MARTIN-ROBICHAUD DJ, 2001, AQUAC RES, V32, P113, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-2109.2001.00538.X; MCDOWALL RM, 2006, FISH FISH, V7, P153, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-2979.2006.00217.X; MCDOWALL RM, 2010, FISH FISH SER, V32, P1, DOI 10.1007/978-90-481-9271-7\_1; MULCAHY DM, 2003, ILAR J, V44, P295, DOI 10.1093/ILAR.44.4.295; MURRAY MJ, 2002, SEMIN AVIAN EXOT PET, V11, P246, DOI 10.1053/SAEP.2002.126571; NAWAZ Z, 2011, SURGERY, V29, P59; NEWMAN DM, 2008, AQUACULTURE, V279, P113, DOI 10.1016/J.AQUACULTURE.2008.03.032; QU QZ, 2010, J APPL ICHTHYOL, V26, P1, DOI 10.1111/J.1439-0426.2009.01377.X; RODGERS CJ, 2009, OPTIONS MEDITERRANEE, V86, P41, DOI DOI 10.13140/2.1.4697.0560; SINDERMANN CJ, 1984, HELGOLANDER MEERESUN, V37, P505, DOI 10.1007/BF01989327; SWENSON EA, 2007, T AM FISH SOC, V136, P994, DOI 10.1577/T06-193.1; TRESTED DG, 2010, N AM J FISH MANAGE, V30, P121, DOI 10.1577/M09-125.1; WAGNER GN, 2011, REV FISH BIOL FISHER, V21, P71, DOI 10.1007/S11160-010-9191-5; WAGNER GN, 2000, T AM FISH SOC, V129, P1196, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129\&LT;1196:EOSTAP\&GT;2.0.CO;2; WAGNER GN, 2005, J AQUAT ANIM HEALTH, V17, P160, DOI 10.1577/H04-037.1; WEST G, 1990, AUST J MAR FRESH RES, V41, P199, DOI 10.1071/MF9900199; WOOSTER G.

SUCH PROJECTS PROVIDE A VALUABLE OPPORTUNITY TO TEST THE EFFICIENCY OF THE TOOL AND THE IMPACTS ON THE RECEIVING AQUATIC COMMUNITIES, AS DISTURBANCE OCCURS AT A KNOWN TIME. THE PISCICIDE ROTENONE' HAS BEEN WIDELY USED TO ERADICATE INVASIVE OR UNWANTED FISH SPECIES WORLDWIDE. HOWEVER, THERE IS LITTLE INFORMATION REGARDING THE IMPACT ON NATIVE FISH BEING REINTRODUCED TO A STREAM AFTER ROTENONE TREATMENT. THE MASS DEPLETION OF AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES DUE TO ROTENONE DOSING IS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN, AS FOOD-LIMITATION COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT ON FISH GROWTH, CONDITION AND RECRUITMENT, COMPROMISING THE AIMS OF REHABILITATION. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW ZEALAND, ROTENONE WAS EMPLOYED TO ERADICATE BROWN TROUT (SALMO TRUTTA) FROM TWO STREAMS THAT ALSO SUPPORTED POPULATIONS OF BANDED KOKOPU (GALAXIAS FASCIATUS). IMPACTS ON FISH AND AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES WERE STUDIED IN TWO TREATMENT AND TWO REFERENCE STREAMS IN KARORI, WELLINGTON. ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT INVERTEBRATE DENSITIES DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE TREATMENT STREAMS IN THE 2-WEEK TO 2-MONTH PERIOD AFTER DOSING. FOLLOWING REINTRODUCTION AFTER ROTENONE TREATMENT, BANDED KOKOPU CONDITION DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY AND LEVELS OF FISH MOBILITY WERE VARIABLE. ONE YEAR AFTER ROTENONE DOSING, THERE WAS RECRUITMENT OF BANDED KOKOPU JUVENILES IN THE TREATMENT STREAMS INDICATING SUCCESSFUL REPRODUCTION, WITH NO EQUIVALENT INCREASE IN THE REFERENCE STREAMS. RESULTS ARE A POSITIVE INDICATION FOR THE USE OF ROTENONE AS AN EFFECTIVE CONSERVATION TOOL TO REMOVE UNWANTED FISH SPECIES WHERE THEY THREATEN NATIVE POPULATIONS.","AKBARIPASAND A, 2011, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V45, P135, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2010.544044; ALLIBONE R, 2010, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V44, P271, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2010.514346; ALLIBONE R, 2003, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V37, P473, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2003.9517182; BATES D., 2012, PACKAGE LME4 LINEAR; BLOXHAM M, 2002, GAMBUSIA GAMBUSIA AF; CHADDERTON W.

THE FITNESS ADVANTAGE OF AMPHIDROMY HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF PROLONGED DEBATE, AND WE EXAMINED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT AMPHIDROMY MAINLY INCREASES FECUNDITY THROUGH THE PRODUCTION OF SMALL PELAGIC LARVAE. WE COMPARED EGG SIZE (A PROXY FOR LARVAL SIZE) OF CLOSELY RELATED NON-MIGRATORY AND AMPHIDROMOUS FISH SPECIES IN THE FAMILIES COTTIDAE, GALAXIIDAE, ELEOTRIDAE AND GOBIIDAE. TO EXAMINE HOW EGG SIZE CHANGES IN RELATION TO BODY SIZE WITHIN A TAXONOMIC GROUP, WE ALSO COMPARED EGG SIZE AND MAXIMUM BODY SIZE ACROSS MOST SPECIES OF NEW ZEALAND NON-MIGRATORY AND AMPHIDROMOUS GALAXIIDS. NON-MIGRATORY SPECIES GENERALLY HAVE RELATIVELY LARGER EGGS THAN THEIR AMPHIDROMOUS CONFAMILIAL SPECIES. THIS PARTICULAR TRAIT HAS EVOLVED INDEPENDENTLY SEVERAL TIMES IN EACH OF THE FOUR FAMILIES OF AMPHIDROMOUS FISH THAT HAVE GIVEN RISE TO SIGNIFICANT FRESHWATER RADIATIONS. AMONGST THE NEW ZEALAND GALAXIIDS, MEAN EGG DIAMETER INCREASED WITH MAXIMUM BODY LENGTH FOR BOTH NON-MIGRATORY AND AMPHIDROMOUS SPECIES; HOWEVER, DESPITE THE CONSIDERABLY SMALLER RELATIVE BODY SIZE OF THE NON-DIADROMOUS SPECIES, THE RATE OF INCREASE IN EGG DIAMETER RELATIVE TO THE INCREASE IN BODY SIZE IS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER IN THE NON-MIGRATORY FISH. WE PROPOSE THAT AMPHIDROMOUS FISH MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF FECUNDITY BY PRODUCING SMALL PELAGIC LARVAE. IN CONTRAST, THE RELATIVELY LARGE EGGS AND WELL-DEVELOPED LARVAE OF NON-MIGRATORY SPECIES INCREASE LARVAL SURVIVAL IN WHAT ARE OFTEN RELATIVELY HARSH AND UNPRODUCTIVE FRESHWATER HABITATS. CONSEQUENTLY, AMPHIDROMOUS SPECIES ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OVER THEIR NON-MIGRATORY RELATIVES WHEN CLOSE TO A PELAGIC HABITAT IN WHICH THEIR LARVAE CAN GROW AND DEVELOP AND THEN MIGRATE UPSTREAM, RELEASING THEM FROM RECRUITMENT LIMITATION AND GIVING THEM A LOCAL REPRODUCTIVE ADVANTAGE OVER THEIR LESS FECUND NON-MIGRATORY RELATIVES. WE ARGUE THAT THE PERSISTENCE AND DISTRIBUTION OF BOTH LIFE-HISTORY STRATEGIES ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE DEPENDS ON THE RELATIVE DIFFERENCE IN THE NET REPRODUCTIVE RETURN FOR EACH STRATEGY IN RELATION TO DISTANCE FROM A PELAGIC LARVAL HABITAT, AS MEDIATED BY THE RELATIVE COSTS OF MIGRATION AND EGG SIZE/FECUNDITY RELATIONSHIPS.","ALDRIDGE DC, 2004, BIOL CONSERV, V119, P253, DOI 10.1016/J.BIOCON.2003.11.008; ALLIBONE RM, 1996, BIOL J LINN SOC, V57, P107, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8312.1996.TB01832.X; ALLIBONE RM, 1997, J FISH BIOL, V51, P1247, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8649.1997.TB01140.X; ALLIBONE RM, 1999, J ROY SOC NEW ZEAL, V29, P291, DOI 10.1080/03014223.1999.9517598; BACON PJ, 2012, J FISH BIOL, V81, P921, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8649.2012.03311.X; BENZIE V, 1968, NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH, V2, P606; BONNETT M.

UNDERSTANDING THE INFLUENCE OF LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS ON GENETIC AND PHENOTYPIC INTRASPECIFIC VARIABILITY CAN YIELD INSIGHTS INTO HOW EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES WORK AS WELL AS PROVIDE ESSENTIAL INFORMATION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY. 2. OUR AIM WAS TO COMPARE THE GENETIC STRUCTURE AND PHENOTYPIC VARIATION AMONG GALAXIAS MACULATUS POPULATIONS INHABITING TWO ATLANTIC OCEAN RIVER BASINS IN PATAGONIA IN RELATION TO HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH LATITUDE. 3. POPULATION GENETIC ANALYSIS (BASED ON EIGHT MICROSATELLITE LOCI, 505 INDIVIDUALS) INDICATES THAT GENETIC STRUCTURE IS MORE PRONOUNCED IN THE RIO NEGRO BASIN (RN) AT 3941 DEGREES S (10 LOCALITIES) THAN IN THE SOUTHERNMOST SANTA CRUZ RIVER BASIN (SCR) AT 4950 DEGREES S (SEVEN LOCALITIES). SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION ANALYSIS SHOWED DIFFERENT EFFECTS OF GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE IN SHAPING POPULATION DIFFERENTIATION PATTERNS IN THE TWO BASINS. 4. WHILE IN NORTHERN PATAGONIA, FRAGMENTED POPULATIONS COULD HAVE SURVIVED THE SEVERITY OF QUATERNARY CLIMATE CYCLES, AT HIGHER LATITUDES G. MACULATUS POPULATIONS WERE PROBABLY EXTIRPATED BY EXTENSIVE ICE SHEETS. EXTANT POPULATIONS IN THE UPPER REACHES OF THE SOUTHERNMOST BASIN PROBABLY ORIGINATED FROM REFUGIA CLOSE TO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. 5. BASED ON OTOLITH MICROCHEMISTRY, WE HAVE DOCUMENTED FACULTATIVE DIADROMY FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR THE SPECIES IN THE SCR BASIN, WHILE NO EVIDENCE OF MIGRATION TO THE SEA WAS FOUND IN INDIVIDUALS FROM THE RN BASIN. VERTEBRAL NUMBER INCREASED WITH LATITUDE, AND WITHIN THE SCR BASIN, THE HIGHER COUNTS ARE POSSIBLY ASSOCIATED WITH A MIGRATORY LIFE STYLE.","ALLIBONE RM, 1993, BIOL J LINN SOC, V50, P19, DOI 10.1006/BIJL.1993.1045; BARBER BR, 2011, BMC EVOL BIOL, V11, DOI 10.1186/1471-2148-11-343; BARRIGA JP, 2007, J APPL ICHTHYOL, V23, P128, DOI 10.1111/J.1439-0426.2006.00820.X; BARRIGA J.

IN CONTRAST, THERE IS A PAUCITY OF KNOWLEDGE ON HOW THE INTERACTION OF ENERGY SUPPLY AND SOCIAL STATUS DETERMINES PATTERNS OF RESIDENCY AND MOVEMENT. THIS STUDY TESTS WHETHER THE PRESENCE OF CONSPECIFICS AND AN INDIVIDUAL'S SOCIAL STATUS IN RELATION TO FOOD SUPPLY INFLUENCE THE FITNESS AND MOVEMENT OF A DRIFT-FEEDING FISH (GALAXIAS FASCIATUS). USING AN INFORMATION-THEORETIC APPROACH (AIC), OUR ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THE MOST PARSIMONIOUS MODEL OF FISH MOVEMENT AMONG POOLS WAS ONE THAT INCLUDED FOOD SUPPLY, SOCIAL RANK AND FISH RELATIVE GROWTH RATE. OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT SUBORDINATE FISH RELOCATED MORE FREQUENTLY COMPARED TO DOMINANT FISH, MOST LIKELY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INTRA-SPECIFIC COMPETITION THAT LIMITED THE ACCESS OF THESE SMALLER FISH TO RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINED THEIR GROWTH.

49,WOS,ARTICLE,2014,RAMEZANI J;LOKMAN PM;AKBARIPASAND A;CLOSS GP,CAN DRIFTING INVERTEBRATES MEET THE ENERGY REQUIREMENTS OF DRIFT-FEEDING FISH? A CASE STUDY ON GALAXIAS FASCIATUS,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,BIOENERGETICS; CARRYING CAPACITY; DRIFT-FEEDING FISH; RESOURCE; LIMITATION; MACROINVERTEBRATES; OXYGEN CONSUMPTION,"RESOURCE AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY DETERMINE THE DISTRIBUTION AND COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF ANIMALS IN ECOSYSTEMS. HOWEVER, THE BALANCE BETWEEN ENERGY SUPPLY AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF SPECIES HAS RECEIVED LITTLE ATTENTION BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF ESTIMATING THESE FACTORS. WE MEASURED THE CARRYING CAPACITY OF A STREAM ECOSYSTEM IN RELATION TO THE METABOLIC DEMANDS OF BANDED KOKOPU (GALAXIAS FASCIATUS), A DRIFT-FEEDING FISH, TO INVESTIGATE THE PROPORTION OF THEIR ENERGY BUDGET MET BY THE SUPPLY OF THEIR PRIMARY PREY, DRIFTING INVERTEBRATES. WE SAMPLED DRIFTING INVERTEBRATES FROM MULTIPLE POOLS IN 2 FRESHWATER STREAMS ONCE A MONTH OVER 1 Y AND MEASURED THEIR ENERGY CONTENT. WE USED THE ENERGY CONTENT OF INDIVIDUAL INVERTEBRATES TO ESTIMATE THE TOTAL ENERGY AVAILABLE IN THE FORM OF DRIFTING INVERTEBRATES IN EACH POOL. WE MEASURED FISH O-2 CONSUMPTION RATE (MG O-2 KG(-1) H(-1)) AND CONVERTED IT TO METABOLIC DEMAND (CAL/H). DRIFTING AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES ALONE APPEAR TO BE INSUFFICIENT TO MEET BANDED KOKOPU ENERGETIC REQUIREMENTS IN MOST SEASONS BECAUSE THE FISH COULD OBTAIN UP TO ONLY 60\% OF THEIR TOTAL ENERGY EXPENDITURE FROM THIS FOOD SOURCE. THIS RESULT INDICATES THAT BANDED KOKOPU MUST ACCESS OTHER SOURCES OF ENERGY, SUCH AS BENTHIC FOOD ITEMS OR TERRESTRIAL INVERTEBRATE INPUTS, ESPECIALLY DURING EPISODIC EVENTS, AND HIGHLIGHTS THE POTENTIAL IMPORTANCE OF TERRESTRIAL-AQUATIC EXCHANGE AND OTHER ENERGETIC SUBSIDIES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT FOOD SUPPLY IS LIKELY TO LIMIT ASSEMBLAGES OF DRIFT-FEEDING FISH AND PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN DETERMINING THE OUTCOME OF INTRASPECIFIC INTERACTIONS, GROWTH, MOVEMENT, AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN STREAMS.","AKBARIPASAND A., 2012, THESIS U OTAGO DUNED; ARMSTRONG JB, 2011, NATURE, V476, P84, DOI 10.1038/NATURE10240; BAKER C.

MORE KNOWLEDGE REGARDING ASPECTS OF THEIR ECOLOGY IS NEEDED IN ORDER FOR CONSERVATION ACTIONS TO BE OPTIMALLY DESIGNED. A 100-M REACH OF SMALL UPLAND STREAM IN MANAWATU, NEW ZEALAND WAS MAPPED TO SCALE AND INVENTORIED FOR MICROHABITAT VARIABLES. FLOW VELOCITY, DEPTH, SURFACE TURBULENCE, SUBSTRATE SIZE AND INTERSTITIAL REFUGE SPACE AVAILABILITY WERE MEASURED IN 0.25-M(2) QUADRATS THROUGHOUT THE REACH. TWENTY-NINE KAIARO AND 22 SHORTJAW KAIKOPU WERE PIT-TAGGED WITHIN THE REACH AND MONITORED DURING THE DAY (N = 26) AND NIGHT (N = 15) IN 2008 WITH A PORTABLE PIT MONITORING SYSTEM. OF THESE, 72 \% OF KAIARO AND 68 \% OF SHORTJAW KAIKOPU WERE DETECTED AT LEAST ONCE AND 62 \% OF KAIARO AND 46 \% OF SHORTJAW KAIKOPU WERE DETECTED FIVE TIMES OR MORE WITHIN THE STUDY REACH. DURING BOTH THE DAY AND NIGHT KAIARO USED MICROHABITATS THAT WERE FASTER-FLOWING, DEEPER, MORE TURBULENT, WITH LARGER SUBSTRATE PARTICLES AND MORE INTERSTITIAL REFUGE SPACES WHEN COMPARED WITH ALL MICROHABITATS AVAILABLE IN THE REACH. SHORTJAW KAIKOPU USED MICROHABITATS WITH LARGER SUBSTRATE PARTICLES AND MORE INTERSTITIAL REFUGE SPACES WHEN COMPARED TO ALL MICROHABITATS AVAILABLE WITHIN THE REACH. DURING THE DAY, SHORTJAW KAIKOPU WERE FOUND IN AREAS WITH LARGER SUBSTRATES AND HIGHER SURFACE TURBULENCE THAN AREAS WHERE THEY WERE FOUND AT NIGHT. FOUR MESOHABITAT TYPES WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE STUDY AREA USING CLUSTER ANALYSES. KAIARO USED THE SAME FLOW CHANNEL-TYPE HABITATS DURING THE DAY AND AT NIGHT. SHORTJAW KAIKOPU USED FLOW CHANNEL AND POOL HABITATS DURING THE DAY, AND USED POOL HABITATS AT NIGHT. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT BIOTIC FACTORS SUCH AS COMPETITION FROM SHORTJAW KAIKOPU MAY HAVE BEEN INFLUENCING KAIARO HABITAT USE PATTERNS. IN ADDITION, THESE FINDINGS HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR RIVER MANAGERS ATTEMPTING TO IMPLEMENT CONSERVATION MEASURES TO PROTECT THESE SPECIES BECAUSE INCREASING ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS SUCH AS SEDIMENTATION AND WATER ABSTRACTION CAN HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON INSTREAM HABITAT.","ALLIBONE R, 2010, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V44, P271, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2010.514346; ALLIBONE RM, 2000, SCI CONSERVATION, V147; BAKER CF, 2007, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V41, P25, DOI 10.1080/00288330709509893; BENEJAM L, 2010, FRESHWATER BIOL, V55, P628, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2427.2009.02299.X; CHADDERTON WL, 2000, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V34, P487, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2000.9516951; CROW SK, 2007, THESIS U OTAGO NZ; CUCHEROUSSET J, 2005, N AM J FISH MANAGE, V25, P270, DOI 10.1577/M04-053.1; CUCHEROUSSET J, 2007, FISH RES, V85, P159, DOI 10.1016/J.FISHRES.2007.01.011; DAVEY AJH, 2011, AQUAT CONSERV, V21, P132, DOI 10.1002/AQC.1166; DIRNWOEBER M, 2012, REMOTE SENS-BASEL, V4, P3346, DOI 10.3390/RS4113346; EDGE KA, 1993, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V27, P357, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1993.9516575; FORTIN MJ, 2005, SPATIAL ANALYSIS: A GUIDE FOR ECOLOGISTS; HAYES JW, 1989, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V23, P171, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1989.9516353; HAYES ML, 1996, FISHERIES TECHNIQUES; HENRY BE, 2008, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V83, P171, DOI 10.1007/S10641-007-9312-8; HILL MS, 2006, FISH RES, V77, P102, DOI 10.1016/J.FISHRES.2005.08.001; HOSMER D., 2000, APPL LOGISTIC REGRES, V2ND ED.; JAKOBER MJ, 2000, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V59, P79, DOI 10.1023/A:1007699610247; JOHNSON SL, 2000, REGUL RIVER, V16, P91, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1646(200001/02)16:1\&LT;91::AID-RRR568\&GT;3.0.CO;2-V; JOWETT IG, 1995, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V29, P13, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1995.9516635; JOWETT IG, 2001, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V35, P605, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2001.9517026; JOY MK, 2004, FRESHWATER BIOL, V49, P1036, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2427.2004.01248.X; LEATHWICK JR, 2005, FRESHWATER BIOL, V50, P2034, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2427.2005.01448.X; LEGENDRE P, 1993, ECOLOGY, V74, P1659, DOI 10.2307/1939924; LINNANSAARI TP, 2007, RIVER RES APPL, V23, P559, DOI 10.1002/RRA.1003; MAIN MR, 1988, THESIS U CANTERBURY; MAIN MR, 1985, 60 MIN AGR FISH FISH; MARTINEZ-CAPEL F, 2009, FISHERIES MANAG ECOL, V16, P52, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2400.2008.00645.X; MCDONALD J.

IN NEW ZEALAND, ONE CONSEQUENCE HAS BEEN A REDUCTION IN THE OBLIGATE RIPARIAN SPAWNING HABITAT OF GALAXIAS MACULATUS. THIS DIADROMOUS SPECIES FORMS THE BASIS OF AN IMPORTANT FISHERY WHERE JUVENILES ARE CAUGHT AS THEY MIGRATE INTO FRESHWATER. SPAWNING SUCCESS OF G. MACULATUS IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE NATURE OF AVAILABLE RIPARIAN HABITAT. WE USED A FIELD EXPERIMENT IN A RURAL STREAM TO TEST WHETHER LIVESTOCK GRAZING LIMITS EGG PRODUCTION AND WHETHER THERE IS A LAG IN INCREASED EGG PRODUCTION AFTER PROTECTION FROM GRAZING BECAUSE OF THE RECOVERY TIME OF RIPARIAN VEGETATION. IN A SEPARATE EXPERIMENT IN AN URBAN STREAM WE TESTED WHETHER IMPROVED RIPARIAN MANAGEMENT CAN INCREASE EGG PRODUCTION. LIVESTOCK EXCLUSION PRODUCED AN IMMEDIATE AND LONG-LASTING INCREASE IN THE HEIGHT AND DENSITY OF RIPARIAN VEGETATION WITH REDUCED FLUCTUATIONS IN THE GROUND-LEVEL PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT, AND POSITIVE CHANGES TO THE DENSITY AND SURVIVAL OF EGGS. AFTER 4YEARS, EGG DENSITIES IN EXCLOSURES WERE 400 TIMES GREATER THAN IN GRAZED CONTROLS AND EGG SURVIVAL HAD DOUBLED. MOWING RIPARIAN VEGETATION 2MONTHS PRIOR TO SPAWNING REDUCED EGG DENSITIES BY 75\% AND SURVIVAL BY 25\%. OUR EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT ALTERING GRAZING AND MOWING IN SPAWNING SITES PRODUCED DENSE RIPARIAN VEGETATION, THAT THIS IMPROVED THE MICROSITE ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTED IN GREATLY INCREASED EGG DEPOSITION AND SURVIVAL OVER SEVERAL YEARS.

ANOTHER GALAXIID, INANGA GALAXIAS MACULATUS, HAD A HIGHER METABOLIC RATE IN BOTH MEDIA BUT THE PROPORTION OF OXYGEN UPTAKE MET BY CUTANEOUS RESPIRATION ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 38 TO 63\% WHEN THE FISH WERE EXPOSED TO AIR. BESIDES ITS IMPORTANT ROLE IN OXYGEN UPTAKE, THE SKIN OF BOTH SPECIES ALSO CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO EXCRETION OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN AIR, INDICATING THE CRITICAL ROLE OF THE INTEGUMENT AS A RESPIRATORY TISSUE. IN AIR, G. MACULATUS MAY INCREASE CUTANEOUS GAS EXCHANGE TO MEET METABOLIC DEMANDS OWING TO THE REDUCED UTILITY OF THE GILLS, BUT AS EMERSED G.

THE LIFE HISTORIES OF SICYDIINAE GOBIES, AYU (PLECOGLOSSUS ALTIVELIS), JAPANESE SCULPINS (COTTUS) AND GALAXIIDS (GALAXIIDAE), SUGGEST THAT THE SICYDIINAE ARE REPRESENTATIVES OF TROPICAL FRESHWATER AMPHIDROMY, WHEREAS AYU, SCULPINS AND GALAXIIDS ARE REPRESENTATIVES OF TEMPERATE FRESHWATER AMPHIDROMY. THE SICYDIINE LARVAL STAGE MAY BE REQUIRED TO OCCUR IN THE OCEAN FOR ALL SPECIES, BUT AYU, SCULPINS AND GALAXIIDS HAVE LANDLOCKED OR FLUVIAL FORMS WITH LARVAE THAT DO NOT NEED TO ENTER THE OCEAN FOR LARVAL FEEDING AND GROWTH. THIS SUGGESTS THAT SICYDIINE LARVAE HAVE A HIGH OCEANIC DEPENDENCY WHEREAS AYU, SCULPINS AND GALAXIID LARVAE HAVE A LOW OCEANIC DEPENDENCY. FRESHWATER AMPHIDROMOUS FISH IN TROPICAL AND TEMPERATE ZONES APPEAR TO HAVE DEVELOPED TWO DIFFERENT STRATEGIES IN THE EVOLUTION OF THEIR LIFE HISTORIES. IT IS LIKELY THAT THE EVOLUTIONARY DIRECTION OF THE LARVAL STAGE OF TROPICAL AMPHIDROMY IS TO REMAIN IN THE SEA AND THAT OF TEMPERATE AMPHIDROMY IS TOWARDS HAVING THE ABILITY TO REMAIN IN FRESHWATER IF NEEDED. TROPICAL AND TEMPERATE AMPHIDROMY APPEAR TO BE BIOLOGICALLY INFORMATIVE CATEGORIES AND EVALUATIONS OF THIS HYPOTHESIS WILL FACILITATE BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE VARIOUS FORMS OF AMPHIDROMY IN THE FUTURE.","AKIHITO P., 1984, FISHES JAPANESE ARCH, P236; ARAI T, 2001, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V216, P253, DOI 10.3354/MEPS216253; AZUMA M, 1981, VERHANDLUNGEN INT VE, V21, P1291; BALON E.K., 1984, P35; BALON E.K., 1985, EARLY LIFE HIST FISH, P280; BELL K.N.I., 1999, NAGA, V22, P30; BELL KNI, 1995, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V52, P1535, DOI 10.1139/F95-147; BELL KNI, 1995, MAR BIOL, V121, P409, DOI 10.1007/BF00349450; BOWEN BW, 2006, MAR BIOL, V149, P899, DOI 10.1007/S00227-006-0252-1; BYEON HK, 1995, KOREAN J ICHTHYOL, V7, P128; CAMPBELL CM, 1976, GEN COMP ENDOCR, V28, P143, DOI 10.1016/0016-6480(76)90166-0; CHEN IS, 2003, RAFFLES B ZOOL, V51, P87; CHUBB AL, 1998, J HERED, V89, P8, DOI 10.1093/JHERED/89.1.8; DELACROIX P, 1987, THESIS U LA REUNION; DOTU Y., 1955, SCI B FAC AGR KYUSHU, V10, P120; EGO K, 1956, LIFE HIST FRESHWATER; ELLIEN C, 2011, CYBIUM, V35, P381; ERDMAN D.

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

55,WOS,ARTICLE,2014,TONKIN JD;TAIPETI KWT;DAVID B;HOKIANGA HT,LEARNING THE ROPES: MUSSEL SPAT ROPES IMPROVE FISH AND SHRIMP PASSAGE THROUGH CULVERTS,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,DIADROMY; FISH PASSAGE; GALAXIAS MACULATUS; INANGA; ONCORHYNCHUS MYKISS; PARATYA CURVIROSTRIS; RAINBOW TROUT; REMEDIATION; RETROFIT; VELOCITY; BARRIER,"1. CULVERT PIPES ARE REGULARLY USED AROUND THE WORLD FOR CONVEYING STREAM FLOWS UNDERGROUND, THROUGH EMBANKMENTS OR UNDER ROAD CROSSINGS. INSTALLATION OF THESE FEATURES CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE PASSAGE OF FRESHWATER BIOTA AND POTENTIALLY EXCLUDE MANY SPECIES FROM LARGE AREAS OF RIVER NETWORKS. 2. WE INVESTIGATED THE INSTALLATION OF MUSSEL SPAT ROPES AS A POTENTIALLY RAPID AND COST-EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR IMPROVING PASSAGE OF FRESHWATER BIOTA THROUGH CULVERT PIPES WHERE INTERNAL BARREL CONDITIONS IMPEDE PASSAGE. WE ASSESSED PASSAGE SUCCESS FOR TWO FISH SPECIES, JUVENILE RAINBOW TROUT ONCORHYNCHUS MYKISS (WALBAUM 1972) AND ADULT INANGA GALAXIAS MACULATUS (JENYNS 1842), AND ONE MIGRATORY SHRIMP, PARATYA CURVIROSTRIS (HELLER 1862), THROUGH CULVERTS OF DIFFERING LENGTH (3 AND 6 M), SLOPE (1.5 AND 3 DEGREES) AND FLOW (0.24 AND 0.75 L S(-1)). WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT ROPES WOULD ENHANCE THE PASSAGE SUCCESS OF THESE THREE SPECIES, BUT SUCCESS RATES WOULD DIFFER BETWEEN SPECIES AND TRIAL COMBINATIONS. 3. ROPES RESULTED IN A REDUCED WATER VELOCITY WITHIN CULVERT BARRELS AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED PASSAGE SUCCESS FOR ALL THREE SPECIES. SHRIMP BENEFITED MOST BY THE PRESENCE OF ROPES, BEING UNABLE TO NEGOTIATE ANY OF THE PIPE COMBINATIONS IN THEIR ABSENCE, BUT EXHIBITING VARYING RATES OF SUCCESS ACROSS ALL COMBINATIONS WITH THEIR PRESENCE. BOTH G.MACULATUS AND O.MYKISS WERE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE SOME OF THE NON-ROPED PIPE COMBINATIONS, BUT AS THE LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY INCREASED, SUCCESSFUL PASSAGE WAS ONLY ACHIEVED WITH THE ROPES PRESENT. 4.

CHILEAN ARTISANAL FISHERY OF G. MACULATUS HAS BECOME LESS IMPORTANT AS A RESOURCE DUE TO MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING OVEREXPLOITATION, POLLUTION, INTRODUCTION OF PREDATORS, AND COMPETITORS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE CURRENT CONSERVATION STATUS OF THE SPECIES IN CHILE IS STILL UNCERTAIN. HERE, WE USED MTDNA CONTROL REGION SEQUENCES (925 BP) TO INVESTIGATE MAIN PATTERNS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY AND STRUCTURE IN POPULATIONS FROM 2 BIOGEOGRAPHIC AREAS ALONG THE CHILEAN COAST. EXTREMELY HIGH LEVELS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY CHARACTERIZE THE SPECIES, SUGGESTING A LOW AMOUNT OF INFLUENCE OF THE LAST GLACIAL CYCLE OVER ITS DEMOGRAPHY COMPARED WITH OTHER STUDIES IN FRESHWATER AND MARINE SOUTH AMERICAN FISHES. HOWEVER, WE RECOGNIZED CONTRASTING GENETIC PATTERNS BETWEEN THE INTERMEDIATE AREA (BETWEEN 30 DEGREES S AND 42 DEGREES S) AND THE MAGELLANIC PROVINCE (BETWEEN 42 DEGREES S AND 56 DEGREES S). ON THE ONE HAND, OVER A NARROW GEOGRAPHICAL RANGE (<200 KM) EACH INTERMEDIATE AREA ESTUARINE POPULATION CONSTITUTES A DIFFERENT GENETIC UNIT. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE MAGELLANIC POPULATIONS OF THE SPECIES EXHIBITED LOW LEVELS OF DIFFERENTIATION IN AN AREA EXTENDING FOR MORE THAN 500 KM. SUCH DIFFERENCES MAY BE A CONSEQUENCE OF DIFFERENT COASTAL CONFIGURATIONS, OCEANOGRAPHIC REGIMES, AND QUATERNARY GLACIAL HISTORIES. FINALLY, OUR RESULTS SUPPORT THE EXISTENCE OF DIFFERENT STOCK UNITS FOR G. MACULATUS AND THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE INTEGRATED IN FUTURE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND AQUACULTURE PROGRAMS FOR THIS SPECIES.","ALJANABI SM, 1997, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V25, P4692, DOI 10.1093/NAR/25.22.4692;

IN FACT, THE NORTHERN GLACIAL LIMIT ALONG THE PACIFIC COAST, AN AREA OF MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES IN TERMS OF TOPOGRAPHY, CURRENTS, AND WATER SALINITY, REPRESENTS A MAJOR BIOGEOGRAPHIC TRANSITION FOR MARINE AND FRESHWATER SPECIES. WE USED MITOCHONDRIAL DNA SEQUENCES (D-LOOP) TO INVESTIGATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF QUATERNARY GLACIAL CYCLES OVER THE PATTERN OF GENETIC DIVERSITY AND STRUCTURE OF G. MACULATUS (PISCES: GALAXIIDAE) ALONG TWO BIOGEOGRAPHICAL PROVINCES IN THE CHILEAN COAST. EXTREME LEVELS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY AND STRONG PHYLOGEOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE CHARACTERIZE THE SPECIES SUGGESTING A LOW AMOUNT OF INFLUENCE OF THE LAST GLACIAL CYCLE OVER ITS DEMOGRAPHY. HOWEVER, WE RECOGNIZED CONTRASTING PATTERNS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY AND STRUCTURE BETWEEN MAIN BIOGEOGRAPHICAL AREAS HERE ANALYZED. ALONG THE INTERMEDIATE AREA (38 DEGREES-41 DEGREES S) EACH ESTUARINE POPULATION CONSTITUTES A DIFFERENT UNIT. IN CONTRAST, MAGELLANIC POPULATIONS (43 DEGREES-53 DEGREES S) EXHIBITED LOW LEVELS OF GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION. CONTRASTING PATTERNS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY AND STRUCTURE RECORDED IN THE SPECIES BETWEEN THE ANALYZED BIOGEOGRAPHIC AREAS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MARKED DIFFERENCES IN ABIOTIC FACTORS (I.E., DIFFERENT COASTAL CONFIGURATIONS, QUATERNARY GLACIAL HISTORIES, AND OCEANOGRAPHIC REGIMES) AND TO INHERENT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SPECIES (I.E., SALT-TOLERANCE, PHYSIOLOGY, AND REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR).","ALJANABI SM, 1997, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V25, P4692, DOI 10.1093/NAR/25.22.4692;

WHILE IT WAS THE FIRST OF THE GALAXIID SPECIES TO BE DESCRIBED, KNOWLEDGE OF ITS ECOLOGY REMAINS RELATIVELY POOR, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO THE REPRODUCTIVE PHASE OF ITS LIFE-CYCLE. THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE FIRST OBSERVATIONS OF GIANT KKOPU SPAWNING SITES IN THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. A TOTAL OF NINE SPAWNING SITES HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED ACROSS TWO SPAWNING SEASONS IN AN URBAN STREAM IN HAMILTON, NEW ZEALAND. GIANT KKOPU ARE CONFIRMED TO FOLLOW A SIMILAR SPAWNING STRATEGY TO THE OTHER WHITEBAIT SPECIES. EGGS ARE DEPOSITED IN RIPARIAN HABITATS WHILE TEMPORARILY SUBMERGED BY ELEVATED WATER LEVELS. EGGS THEN DEVELOP TERRESTRIALLY BEFORE HATCHING WHEN THE EGG DEPOSITION SITES ARE RE-INUNDATED DURING LATER HIGH FLOWS. THIS SPAWNING STRATEGY LEAVES GIANT KKOPU HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO FLOW REGIME AND RIPARIAN ALTERATIONS.","BENZIE V, 1968, NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH, V2, P606; BONNETT ML, 2002, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V36, P13, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2002.9517067; CHARTERIS SC, 2003, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V37, P493, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2003.9517184; CHARTERIS SC, 2002, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V36, P789, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2002.9517131; DAVID B, 2004, DOC SCI INTERNAL SER; DAVID BO, 2002, T AM FISH SOC, V131, P762, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<0762:BOASDF>2.0.CO;2; FLEMING A, 2013, DNA IDENTIFICATION E; GOODMAN J.

THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF BOTH SPECIES VARIED ALONG THE RIVER, WITH THREE CLEARLY DEFINED AREAS INCLUDING AN UPSTREAM ``HIGH RAINBOW TROUT TO PUYEN RATIO'' AREA (WITH ABUNDANCES OF 75 AND 25 \%, RESPECTIVELY), A MIDSTREAM ``INTERMEDIATE RAINBOW TROUT TO PUYEN RATIO'' AREA (RELATIVE ABUNDANCES BETWEEN 75 AND 25 \%), AND A DOWNSTREAM ``LOW RAINBOW TROUT TO PUYEN RATIO'' AREA. THE DIET OF THE 2 SPECIES WAS ANALYZED ACROSS THESE 3 AREAS EXAMINING STOMACH CONTENT. DIET SIMILARITY BETWEEN SPECIES WAS ANALYZED USING A NON-METRIC MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING ORDINATION TECHNIQUE; PREY ELECTIVITY WAS EVALUATED WITH THE IVLEV'S INDEX; FEEDING TACTICS WERE STUDIED BY ESTIMATING PREY-SPECIFIC ABUNDANCE. BOTH SPECIES SHOWED A GENERALIST FEEDING TACTIC, WITH PUYEN EXHIBITING A MORE VARIED DIET. PREY ELECTIVITY WAS SIMILAR IN BOTH SPECIES, WITH THE MAYFLY (MERIDIALARIS CHILOEENSIS), STONEFLIES (KLAPOPTERYX KUSCHELI AND ANTARCTOPERLA MICHAELSENI), AND THE AMPHIPOD (HYALELLA SP.) BEING THE MOST FREQUENTLY CONSUMED PREY. A SIGNIFICANT DIET OVERLAP WAS FOUND ONLY IN THE DOWNSTREAM AREAS WHERE A HIGHER PROPORTION OF NATIVE FISH OCCURS. THE LOW DIET OVERLAP IN UPSTREAM LOCATIONS MIGHT BE BECAUSE OF THE HIGH DENSITY OF RAINBOW TROUT; WHILE MID-STREAM COULD BE DUE TO THE HIGH SECONDARY PRODUCTIVITY SPOTS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE DIET OF NATIVE PUYEN CHANGED IN RELATION TO THE ABUNDANCES OF RAINBOW TROUT IN THE STREAM.","ABRAMS P, 1980, ECOLOGY, V61, P44, DOI 10.2307/1937153; AMUNDSEN PA, 1996, J FISH BIOL, V48, P607, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8649.1996.TB01455.X; ARISMENDI I, 2014, REV FISH BIOL FISHER, V24, P919, DOI 10.1007/S11160-014-9351-0; ARISMENDI I, 2012, AUSTRAL ECOL, V37, P346, DOI 10.1111/J.1442-9993.2011.02282.X; ARISMENDI I, 2009, FRESHWATER BIOL, V54, P1135, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2427.2008.02157.X; BASULTO S, 2003, LARGO VIAJE SALMONS; BOHN T, 2008, BIOL INVASIONS, V10, P359, DOI 10.1007/S10530-007-9135-8; BRUNET F, 2005, HYDROL PROCESS, V19, P3321, DOI 10.1002/HYP.5973; BURIA L, 2007, FUND APPL LIMNOL, V168, P145, DOI 10.1127/1863-9135/2007/0168-0145; CARREA C, 2013, FRESHWATER BIOL, V58, P36, DOI 10.1111/FWB.12036; CHIPPS SR, 2007, ANAL INTERPRETATION, P130; CLARKE K.R, 2001, CHANGE MARINE COMMUN; CLARKE K.R., 2006, PRIMERV6 USER MANUAL; CLARKE KR, 1993, AUST J ECOL, V18, P117, DOI 10.1111/J.1442-9993.1993.TB00438.X; COGHLAN SM, 2007, J FRESHWATER ECOL, V22, P591, DOI 10.1080/02705060.2007.9664820; COLWELL RK, 1971, ECOLOGY, V52, P567, DOI 10.2307/1934144; CORREA C, 2012, FRESHWATER BIOL, V57, P1769, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2427.2012.02837.X; CROWL T.A., 1992, REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES, V2, P217, DOI 10.1007/BF00045038; DI PRINZIO CY, 2013, FISHERIES MANAG ECOL, V20, P414, DOI 10.1111/FME.12028; DOMINGUEZ E, 2009, MACROINVERTEBRADOS B; ELGUETA A, 2013, J FISH BIOL, V82, P430, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8649.2012.03489.X; FLECKER AS, 1994, ECOL APPL, V4, P798, DOI 10.2307/1942009; GILLER PS, 1984, COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; GLOVA G.

INTRODUCED SALMONIDS HAVE COEXISTED WITH NATIVE FISH SINCE THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY IN PATAGONIAN WATER BODIES, THUS GENERATING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MECHANISMS THAT FACILITATE THEIR COEXISTENCE. WE ANALYZED THE TROPHIC AND SPATIAL INTRA-AND INTER-SPECIFIC RELATIONSHIPS ESTABLISHED AMONG NATIVE AND SALMONID SPECIES IN A DEEP OLIGOTROPHIC LAKE OF PATAGONIA IN ORDER TO DETERMINE NICHE PARTITIONING PATTERNS AS STRATEGIES FOR THEIR COEXISTENCE. SALMONIDS WERE MORE GENERALIST FEEDERS, WHILE NATIVE SPECIES HAD NARROWER TROPHIC NICHES. NATIVE FISH AND INTRODUCED SALMONIDS PARTITIONED FOOD, MAINLY THROUGH THE CONSUMPTION OF THE CRAYFISH SAMASTACUS SP. AND THE NATIVE GALAXIID GALAXIAS MACULATUS, RESPECTIVELY. THE DIET OF MOST SPECIES CHANGED WITH BODY SIZE, SHIFTING FROM INSECTS/AMPHIPODS TO THE LARGER G. MACULATUS AND CRAYFISH. TROPHIC INTERACTIONS VARIED WITH SEASON, IN ASSOCIATION WITH PREY SEASONALITY. IN GENERAL, FISHES FEEDING ON THE SAME PREY WERE CAPTURED IN THE SAME DEPTH STRATA, INDICATING COMMON USE OF FOOD AND SPACE. OUR RESULTS PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE ON THE TROPHIC ECOLOGY OF A MIXED FISH COMMUNITY (EXOTIC-NATIVE), SUPPORTING THE IDEA THAT NATIVE AND NON-NATIVE FISHES COULD BE AVOIDING NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS (E.G., COMPETITION) THROUGH TROPHIC AND SPATIAL RESOURCE PARTITIONING.","AIGO J, 2008, REV FISH BIOL FISHER, V18, P387, DOI 10.1007/S11160-007-9080-8; BARRIGA J.

45,WOS,ARTICLE,2015,WHITE RSA;MCHUGH PA;GLOVER AR;MCINTOSH AR,MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS INCREASE THE REALISED NICHE BREADTH OF A FOREST-DWELLING FISH,ECOGRAPHY,NA,"UNDERSTANDING THE DETERMINANTS OF SPECIES' NICHE BREADTH IS IMPORTANT DUE TO THE NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NICHE BREADTH AND EXTINCTION PROBABILITY. SPECIES TOLERANT TO EXTREMELY HARSH ABIOTIC CONDITIONS (E.G. LOW PH OR HYPOXIA) OFTEN HAVE RELATIVELY SMALL REALISED NICHES DUE TO A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN ABIOTIC AND BIOTIC STRESS TOLERANCE, AND ARE THEREFORE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO EXTINCTION. WE HYPOTHESISED THAT TOLERANCE TO MULTIPLE EXTREME CONDITIONS (E.G. LOW PH, HYPOXIA AND DROUGHT) IN BROWN MUDFISH NEOCHANNA APODA, WOULD INCREASE THEIR REALISED NICHE BREADTH BECAUSE EACH EXTREME WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIVE REFUGE AGAINST A DOMINANT SPECIES, THE BANDED KOKOPU GALAXIAS FASCIATUS. FISH DISTRIBUTIONS WERE SURVEYED IN 65 PEAT-SWAMP-FOREST STREAMS AND POOLS IN NEW ZEALAND, WHICH VARIED IN DISSOLVED OXYGEN, ACIDITY AND HYDROPERIOD. MUDFISH DISTRIBUTION WAS EXTREMELY PATCHY, AND ALMOST COMPLETELY ALLOPATRIC WITH KOKOPU. ALLOPATRY WAS DRIVEN MAINLY BY POOL HYDROPERIOD; MUDFISH OCCUPIED 88 PERCENT OF TEMPORARY POOLS DUE TO THEIR TOLERANCE OF HABITAT DRYING, WHEREAS KOKOPU WERE ABSENT FROM TEMPORARY POOLS. WITHIN PERMANENT POOLS, MUDFISH OCCURRENCE WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO POOL OXYGEN AND PH, WHEREAS KOKOPU OCCURRENCE WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THESE CONDITIONS. POOL CONDITIONS WERE INDEPENDENTLY DISTRIBUTED IN THE LANDSCAPE, SUGGESTING THAT EACH ABIOTIC STRESSOR OFFERED ADDITIVE REFUGE FOR MUDFISH FROM KOKOPU PREDATION/COMPETITION. CONSEQUENTLY, THE MUDFISH REALISED NICHE BREADTH DEPENDED ON THE NUMBER OF ABIOTIC FACTORS DRIVING THEIR ALLOPATRY WITH KOKOPU. GIVEN THE WIDESPREAD NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN NICHE BREADTH AND SPECIES EXTINCTION PROBABILITIES, OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT TOLERANCE TO MULTIPLE STRESSORS MAY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN INSURING SPECIES PERSISTENCE AGAINST THE MULTIPLE DRIVERS OF GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE.","ADAMS JA, 1991, J ROY SOC NEW ZEAL, V21, P33, DOI 10.1080/03036758.1991.10416108; ARAUJO MB, 2012, ECOLOGY, V93, P1527, DOI 10.1890/11-1930.1; BEAMISH FWH, 2003, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V68, P1, DOI 10.1023/A:1026004315978; BOULANGEAT I, 2012, J BIOGEOGR, V39, P204, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2699.2011.02581.X; BRINSON MM, 2002, ENVIRON CONSERV, V29, P115, DOI 10.1017/S0376892902000085; BROENNIMANN O, 2006, GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL, V12, P1079, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2486.2006.01157.X; BRYANT MASON D., 2000, NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT, V20, P923, DOI 10.1577/1548-8675(2000)020<0923:EFPBRM>2.0.CO;2; BURNHAM K.P., 2002, MODEL SELECTION MULT; CHASE JM, 1996, OIKOS, V76, P103, DOI 10.2307/3545752; CHASE JM, 2007, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V104, P17430, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.0704350104; CHEW SF, 2004, J EXP BIOL, V207, P777, DOI 10.1242/JEB.00813; CLOSS GP, 1996, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V47, P17, DOI 10.1007/BF00002376; COLLIER KJ, 1990, OIKOS, V59, P33, DOI 10.2307/3545119; ELDON G.

THIS STUDY USED MARK AND RECAPTURE EXPERIMENTS WITH JUVENILE GALAXIIDS IN THE MOKAU RIVER TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF FLOW ON MIGRATION AND CAPTURE RATES. RECAPTURE RATES OF MARKED FISH RANGED BETWEEN 2.7\% AND 26.9\%, WITH THE PROPORTION OF FISH RECAPTURED POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH INCREASING RIVER FLOW. INCREASING RIVER FLOW NEGATIVELY AFFECTED THE UPSTREAM MIGRATION RATES OF FISH. MIGRATION RATES THROUGH THE TIDAL ZONE COULD BE RAPID, WITH FISH TRAVELLING UPSTREAM AT SPEEDS UP TO 1.4 KM H(-1) WITHIN 24 H OF RELEASE. HOWEVER, NOT ALL MARKED FISH EXHIBITED RAPID UPSTREAM MOVEMENT. FISH CAPTURED ON THE SECOND DAY FOLLOWING RELEASE HAD TRAVELLED AT SLOWER SPEEDS UP TO 0.7 KM H(-1), SUGGESTING THAT THESE FISH DID NOT INITIATE THEIR MIGRATION ON THE TIDAL CYCLE SUBSEQUENT TO THEIR LIBERATION. A SMALL PROPORTION OF FISH WERE ALSO FOUND TO TRAVEL UP TO 15 KM DOWNSTREAM FOLLOWING RELEASE AT THE UPPER END OF THE TIDAL ZONE. RESULTS INDICATED THAT SOME FISH MIGRATED ON BOTH DIURNAL AND NOCTURNAL TIDAL CYCLES. NOCTURNAL MIGRATIONS BY JUVENILE GALAXIIDS COULD REDUCE CAPTURE RATES AND INCREASE RECRUITMENT, ESPECIALLY IN SMALLER RIVERS AND STREAMS WHERE FISH CAN PASS THE TIDAL FISHING AREA ON A SINGLE OVERNIGHT TIDAL CYCLE. THESE RESULTS HAVE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS FOR RIVER SYSTEMS WHERE JUVENILE GALAXIIDS ARE EXPOSED TO MULTIPLE DAYS FISHING PRESSURE, AS REDUCING FISHABLE ZONES COULD BE ONE MEANS OF REDUCING PRESSURE ON UNSTABLE OR DECLINING GALAXIID POPULATIONS.","ALLEN GR, 2002, FIELD GUIDE FRESHWAT; ALLIBONE R, 1999, WATER ATMOSPHERE, V7, P11; BAKER CF, 2007, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V41, P25, DOI 10.1080/00288330709509893; BENBOW ME, 2004, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V527, P139; EDELINE E, 2006, J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL, V331, P217, DOI 10.1016/J.JEMBE.2005.10.011; EDELINE E, 2004, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V282, P261, DOI 10.3354/MEPS282261; FRANKLIN PA, 2012, AQUAT CONSERV, V22, P489, DOI 10.1002/AQC.2232; HANCHET SM, 1989, 110 NZ FRESHW FISH; HICKFORD MJH, 2011, OECOLOGIA, V166, P131, DOI 10.1007/S00442-010-1834-7; HICKS M, 2004, FRESHWATERS NZ, P12 1; HSU J.

THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT LARGE-SCALE REMEDIATION OF DISCHARGES CAN REVERSE THE IMPACTS OF AMD ON FISH MIGRATION.","APHA AWWA WEF, 2005, STANDARD METHODS EXA, V21; BAKER JP, 1982, WATER AIR SOIL POLL, V18, P289, DOI 10.1007/BF02419419; BLACK A, 2005, METAL CONTAMINANTS N, P247; BOUBEE JAT, 1997, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V31, P61, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1997.9516745; CHADDERTON WL, 2000, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V34, P487, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2000.9516951; COLLIER KJ, 1990, OIKOS, V59, P33, DOI 10.2307/3545119; COLLIER KJ, 1987, FRESHWATER BIOL, V18, P227, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2427.1987.TB01310.X; CRAVOTTA CA, 2010, MINE WATER ENVIRON, V29, P176, DOI 10.1007/S10230-010-0112-6; DAVIES H, 2011, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V409, P2971, DOI 10.1016/J.SCITOTENV.2011.04.034; EIKAAS HS, 2006, ECOL APPL, V16, P987, DOI 10.1890/1051-0761(2006)0160987:HLTDOC2.0.CO;2; GRAY DP, 2012, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V46, P335, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2012.663764; GREIG HS, 2010, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V408, P3240, DOI 10.1016/J.SCITOTENV.2010.04.006; HARDING J., 2004, FRESHWATERS NZ; HARDING J., 2005, METAL CONTAMINANTS N, P343; HARDING JS, 2006, DISTRIBUTION NATIVE; HENRY TB, 1999, T AM FISH SOC, V128, P919, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(1999)128<0919:ATOAAM>2.0.CO;2; HICKEY CW, 1998, ENVIRON TOXICOL CHEM, V17, P2338, DOI 10.1897/1551-5028(1998)017\&LT;2338:EOHMOB\&GT;2.3.CO;2, 10.1002/ETC.5620171126; JELLYMAN PG, 2014, J FISH BIOL, V85, P1746, DOI 10.1111/JFB.12497; KRUSE NA, 2012, MINE WATER ENVIRON, V31, P266, DOI 10.1007/S10230-012-0194-4; LEON EA, 2002, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V36, P81, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2002.9517072; MCDOWALL RM, 1998, FRESHWATER BIOL, V40, P111; MCINTOSH AR, 2000, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V57, P2140, DOI 10.1139/CJFAS-57-10-2140; MCINTOSH AR, 2004, FRESHWATERS NZ; MEW G, 1980, SOIL GROUPS NZ 5, P238; NIYOGI DK, 2002, ECOSYSTEMS, V5, P554, DOI 10.1007/S10021-002-0182-9; NORTON D, 1997, NGAKAWAU ECOLOGICAL; OLSSON K, 2006, BIOL CONSERV, V130, P255, DOI 10.1016/J.BIOCON.2005.12.019; PANE EF, 2004, J EXP BIOL, V207, P1249, DOI 10.1242/JEB.00871; PEURANEN S, 1994, ANN ZOOL FENN, V31, P389; QUINN GP, 2002, EXPT DESIGN DATA ANA; RICHARDSON J, 2002, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V36, P431, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2002.9517098; RICHARDSON J, 2001, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V35, P191, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2001.9516989; ROWE DK, 2009, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V43, P1029, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2009.9626526; STOERTZ M.W., 2002, MINE WATER ENVIRON, V21, P60, DOI DOI 10.1007/S102300200021; VUORI KM, 1995, ANN ZOOL FENN, V32, P317; WEBER PA, 2004, APPL GEOCHEM, V19, P1953, DOI 10.1016/J.APGEOCHEM.2004.05.002; WEST DW, 1997, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V31, P461, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1997.9516779; WINTERBOURN MJ, 1996, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V341, P101, DOI 10.1007/BF00018114; WINTERBOURN MJ, 1987, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V153, P277, DOI 10.1007/BF00007214; ZWICK P, 1992, BIODIVERS CONSERV, V1, P80, DOI 10.1007/BF00731036",10.1080/00288330.2016.1184170,0,NEW ZEALAND;NEW ZEALAND;NEW ZEALAND,52,TERTIARY,UOC,NZ,WEST COAST,Y,N,N,N,N,N,REGIONAL,20,Y,7,2,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,NA,NA,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,Y,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N

MACULATUS CONSTITUTES A DECLINING FISHERY. REPRODUCTIVE ACTIVITY WAS DELAYED BY 1MONTH ON THE WEST COAST COMPARED WITH THE EAST COAST AND THE WEST COAST SPAWNING SEASON WAS PROLONGED INTO WINTER. THE EVIDENCE FOR POST-SPAWNING SURVIVAL OF SOME FISH WAS UNEQUIVOCAL FROM HISTOLOGICAL STUDIES. THESE OLDER AND LARGER FISH CONTRIBUTED DISPROPORTIONATELY TO EGG PRODUCTION. ESTIMATES OF FECUNDITY WERE CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN THOSE PREVIOUSLY CALCULATED FOR NZ POPULATIONS. THE IMPORTANCE OF QUALITY HABITATS BEING AVAILABLE DURING CRITICAL LIFE HISTORY PERIODS ARE HIGHLIGHTED. IT WAS APPARENT THAT SOME STREAMS SUPPORTED FISH THAT WERE LARGER AND IN BETTER CONDITION AND THAT THIS TRANSLATED INTO GREATLY INCREASED FECUNDITY. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD FOCUS ON WHETHER THIS IS A LEGACY OF THESE FISH EXPERIENCING BETTER PRE-SETTLEMENT MARINE HABITAT AS LARVAE, OR HIGHER QUALITY INSTREAM HABITAT ENHANCING THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF ADULTS.

THE AMPHIDROMOUS TELEOST FISH, GALAXIAS MACULATUS IS FOUND MAINLY MIGRATING BETWEEN ESTUARIES AND RIVERS, BUT SOME LANDLOCKED POPULATIONS HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED IN LAKES FORMED DURING THE LAST DEGLACIATION PROCESS IN THE ANDES. IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE USE MTDNA SEQUENCES TO RECONSTRUCT THE HISTORICAL SCENARIO OF COLONIZATION OF SUCH A LAKE AND EVALUATED THE OSMOREGULATORY SHIFT ASSOCIATED TO CHANGES IN HABITAT AND LIFE CYCLE BETWEEN AMPHIDROMOUS AND LANDLOCKED POPULATIONS. RESULTS STANDARD DIVERSITY INDICES INCLUDING THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF NUCLEOTIDE DIFFERENCES (PI) AND THE HAPLOTYPE DIVERSITY INDEX (H) INDICATED THAT BOTH POPULATIONS WERE, AS EXPECTED, GENETICALLY DISTINCTIVE, BEING THE LANDLOCKED POPULATION LESS DIVERSE THAN THE DIADROMOUS ONE. SIMILARLY, PAIRWISE G(ST) AND N-ST COMPARISON DETECTED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BOTH POPULATIONS, WHILE GENEALOGY OF HAPLOTYPES EVIDENCED A RECENT FOUNDER EFFECT FROM THE DIADROMOUS STOCK, FOLLOWED BY AN EXPANSION PROCESS IN THE LAKE. TO TEST FOR PHYSIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES, INDIVIDUALS OF BOTH POPULATIONS WERE CHALLENGED WITH A RANGE OF SALINITIES FROM 0 TO 30 PPT FOR 8 DAYS FOLLOWING A PERIOD OF PROGRESSIVE ACCLIMATION. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE LANDLOCKED POPULATION HAD A SURPRISINGLY WIDER TOLERANCE TO SALINITY, AS LANDLOCKED FISH SURVIVAL WAS 100\% FROM 0 TO 20 PPT, WHEREAS DIADROMOUS FISH SURVIVAL WAS 100\% ONLY FROM 10 TO 15 PPT. THE ACTIVITY OF ATPASE ENZYMES, INCLUDING NA+/K+-ATPASE (NKA), AND H+-ATPASE (HA) WAS MEASURED IN GILLS AND INTESTINE. ACTIVITY DIFFERENCES WERE DETECTED BETWEEN THE POPULATIONS AT THE LOWEST SALINITIES, INCLUDING DIFFERENCES IN ATPASES OTHER THAN NKA AND HA. POPULATION DIFFERENCES IN MORTALITY ARE NOT REFLECTED IN ENZYME ACTIVITY DIFFERENCES, SUGGESTING DIVERGENCE IN OTHER PROCESSES.

TO CIRCUMVENT THESE ISSUES, WE SUBJECTED WILD AND CAPTIVITY-ACCLIMATED GIANT KOKOPU (GALAXIAS ARGENTEUS), A HITHERTO UNEXPLORED GALAXIID, TO CAPTIVE BREEDING PROTOCOLS AND EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF SALINITY AND TEMPERATURE ON EGG FERTILISATION, INCUBATION DURATION AND HATCHING. EGGS SOURCED OVER SEVERAL SPAWNING SEASONS WERE SUBJECTED TO DIFFERENT SALINITY (0, 9, 15, 20 AND 30-35 PSU) AND TEMPERATURE (4, 10, 15 AND 17 DEGREES C) COMBINATIONS. AVERAGE FERTILISATION RATES WERE HIGHEST (95\%) WHEN GAMETES WERE ACTIVATED IN FRESH WATER (0 PSU) AND DECLINED AS SALINITY INCREASED. AVERAGE HATCH RATES WERE HIGHEST (71-68\%) WHEN EGGS WERE INCUBATED IN FRESH WATER (0 PSU) AT 10 DEGREES C AND DECREASED AS SALINITY AND TEMPERATURE INCREASED. SEQUENTIAL STAGES OF EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT WERE DOCUMENTED AND SEVERAL YEAR CLASSES OF OFFSPRING WERE PRODUCED TO FORM A CAPTIVE BREEDING COLONY. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE GIANT KOKOPU HAS NOTABLE REPRODUCTION-RELATED QUALITIES THAT MAY BE USEFUL FOR FUTURE AQUACULTURE EXPLOITATION OF THIS SPECIES.","ALLIBONE R, 2010, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V44, P271, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2010.514346; BOBE J, 2010, GEN COMP ENDOCR, V165, P535, DOI 10.1016/J.YGCEN.2009.02.011; BROOKS S, 1997, REV FISH BIOL FISHER, V7, P387, DOI 10.1023/A:1018400130692; CHATERIS S.C., 2003, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V37, P493; COOKE SJ, 2013, CONSERV PHYSIOL, V1, DOI 10.1093/CONPHYS/COT001; DAVID B, 2002, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V63, P416, DOI 10.1023/A:1014990830642; FISCH KM, 2013, J HERED, V104, P92, DOI 10.1093/JHERED/ESS084; HAGGERTY JH, 2007, J RURAL STUD, V23, P222, DOI 10.1016/J.JRURSTUD.2006.11.002; HICKS A, 2010, MAR FRESHWATER RES, V61, P1252, DOI 10.1071/MF10011; JEFFS A., 2003, AKL2003012 NIWAN ENT; JELLYMAN D J, 1979, MAURI ORA, V7, P53; MARDONES A, 2008, AQUAC RES, V39, P731, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2109.2008.01925.X; MARDONES A, 2012, AQUACULTURE, P285; MCDOWALL RM, 2006, FISH FISH, V7, P153, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-2979.2006.00217.X; MCDOWALL R.

WE USED OTOLITH MICROCHEMISTRY TO INVESTIGATE PHILOPATRY IN GALAXIAS MACULATUS, WHOSE JUVENILES CONSTITUTE AN IMPORTANT BUT DECLINING COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL FISHERY IN NEW ZEALAND. USING LASER ABLATION INDUCTIVELY COUPLED PLASMA MASS SPECTROMETRY, WE ANALYSED THE ELEMENTAL SIGNATURE OF EMBRYONIC OTOLITHS FROM G. MACULATUS HATCHLINGS FROM 12 RIVERS ON THE EAST AND WEST COASTS OF THE SOUTH ISLAND OF NEW ZEALAND. WE THEN ANALYSED THE CORE REGION OF THE OTOLITHS OF RECRUITS FROM THE SAME COHORT AS THEY ENTER THESE RIVERS 6 MO LATER. THE MULTI-ELEMENTAL SIGNATURES OF HATCHLING OTOLITHS PRODUCED A HIGH DEGREE OF DIFFERENTIATION AMONG THE 12 RIVERS. USING A MULTIVARIATE APPROACH, THE STREAMS TENDED TO SEPARATE INTO EAST COAST OR WEST COAST CATEGORIES, DRIVEN LARGELY BY THE INFLUENCE OF THE RELATIVE VALUES OF AL AND FE IN THE OTOLITHS. WHEN THE RESULTING DISCRIMINANT MODEL WAS USED TO CLASSIFY THE MULTI-ELEMENTAL SIGNATURE AT THE CORE OF RECRUIT OTOLITHS, VERY FEW (2.8\%) APPEARED TO HAVE RETURNED TO THEIR NATAL RIVER. CONNECTION OF G. MACULATUS POPULATIONS WITHIN ECOLOGICAL TIME FRAMES SEEMS TO BE A COMMON OCCURRENCE, ESPECIALLY WITHIN BROAD REGIONS OF THE COAST.

WE PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT WESTERN AUSTRALIAN POPULATIONS, ON THE BASIS OF A COMBINATION OF GENETIC, GEOGRAPHIC AND ECOLOGICAL CRITERIA, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AN EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANT UNIT, WHICH MERITS MANAGEMENT AS A HIGH CONSERVATION PRIORITY. SUBSTRUCTURE AT NUCLEAR AND MATRILINEAL GENETIC MARKERS IS NOT SUGGESTIVE OF SPECIES-LEVEL DIVERGENCE, BUT RATHER OF DISCRETE WESTERN AND EASTERN AUSTRALIAN SUBPOPULATIONS WITH LIMITED CONTEMPORARY GENE FLOW. IN CONTRAST TO MANY EASTERN POPULATIONS THAT ARE DIADROMOUS, ALL WESTERN POPULATIONS ARE POTAMODROMOUS. ADULTS LIVE AND SPAWN IN RIVERINE HABITATS AND LARVAE DRIFT DOWNSTREAM TO COASTAL LAKES, WHERE THEY SPEND SEVERAL MONTHS, BEFORE UNDERTAKING A DISTINCT UPSTREAM RECRUITMENT MIGRATION AS JUVENILES TO COLONISE RIVERINE HABITATS. INSTREAM BARRIERS THAT DISCONNECT RIVERINE AND LENTIC HABITATS RESTRICT DISTRIBUTIONAL RANGE AND PRESUMABLY AFFECT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF WESTERN AUSTRALIAN POPULATIONS. CONSERVING THE REMAINING POPULATIONS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA WILL REQUIRE ONGOING EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF EMERGING THREATS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO INSTREAM BARRIERS, INTRODUCED SPECIES AND REDUCTIONS IN WATER QUANTITY AND QUALITY.

THIS ASSUMPTION IS OFTEN CRITICISED ON THE GROUNDS THAT 0.75 SCALING OF METABOLIC RATE WITH BODY SIZE IS NOT UNIVERSAL AND CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON SPECIES AND LIFE-HISTORY. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED HOW INTERSPECIFIC VARIATION IN METABOLIC SCALING RELATIONSHIPS AFFECTS POPULATION DENSITY IN DIFFERENT SIZED SPECIES. HERE WE PREDICT INTER-SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN METABOLISM FROM NICHE REQUIREMENTS, THEREBY ALLOWING METABOLIC PREDICTIONS OF SPECIES DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE AT FINE SPATIAL SCALES. DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES IN ENERGETIC EFFICIENCY REQUIRED ALONG HARSH-BENIGN GRADIENTS, AN EXTREMOPHILE FISH (BROWN MUDFISH, NEOCHANNA APODA) LIVING IN HARSH ENVIRONMENTS HAD SLOWER METABOLISM, AND THUS HIGHER POPULATION DENSITIES, COMPARED TO A FISH SPECIES (BANDED KOKOPU, GALAXIAS FASCIATUS) IN PHYSIOLOGICALLY MORE BENIGN HABITATS. INTERSPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN THE INTERCEPTS FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BODY AND DENSITY DISAPPEARED WHEN SPECIES MASS-SPECIFIC METABOLIC RATES, RATHER THAN BODY SIZES, WERE USED TO PREDICT DENSITY, IMPLYING POPULATION ENERGY USE WAS EQUIVALENT BETWEEN MUDFISH AND KOKOPU. NEVERTHELESS, DESPITE SIGNIFICANT INTERSPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN THE SLOPE OF THE METABOLIC SCALING RELATIONSHIPS, MUDFISH AND KOKOPU HAD A COMMON SLOPE FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BODY SIZE AND POPULATION DENSITY. THESE RESULTS SUPPORT UNDERLYING LOGIC OF ENERGETIC EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT SIZE SPECIES IMPLICIT IN METABOLIC THEORY. HOWEVER, THE PRECISE SLOPE OF METABOLIC SCALING RELATIONSHIPS, WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF MUCH DEBATE, MAY NOT BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF POPULATION DENSITY AS EXPECTED UNDER METABOLIC THEORY.","BEGON M, 1986, OIKOS, V46, P122, DOI 10.2307/3565389; BIRO PA, 2010, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V25, P653, DOI 10.1016/J.TREE.2010.08.003; BLACKBURN TM, 1999, ADV ECOL RES, V28, P181, DOI 10.1016/S0065-2504(08)60033-1; BOKMA F, 2004, FUNCT ECOL, V18, P184, DOI 10.1111/J.0269-8463.2004.00817.X; BROWN JH, 1993, AM NAT, V142, P573, DOI 10.1086/285558; BROWN JH, 2004, ECOLOGY, V85, P1771, DOI 10.1890/03-9000; BURTON T, 2011, P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI, V278, P3465, DOI 10.1098/RSPB.2011.1778; CARBONE C, 2002, SCIENCE, V295, P2273, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.1067994; CHEW SF, 2004, J EXP BIOL, V207, P777, DOI 10.1242/JEB.00813; COMOR V, 2014, SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM, V72, P203, DOI 10.1016/J.SOILBIO.2014.02.003; CRAWLEY MJ, 2012, R BOOK, P1; DAMUTH J, 1981, NATURE, V290, P699, DOI 10.1038/290699A0; DELONG JP, 2008, OIKOS, V117, P1329, DOI 10.1111/J.0030-1299.2008.16832.X; ENQUIST BJ, 1998, NATURE, V395, P163, DOI 10.1038/25977; GLAZIER DS, 2010, BIOL REV, V85, P111, DOI 10.1111/J.1469-185X.2009.00095.X; GLAZIER DS, 2005, BIOL REV, V80, P611, DOI 10.1017/S1464793105006834; GLAZIER DS, 2006, BIOSCIENCE, V56, P325, DOI 10.1641/0006-3568(2006)56325:TPLINU2.0.CO;2; GUISAN A, 2005, ECOL LETT, V8, P993, DOI 10.1111/J.1461-0248.2005.00792.X; HOCHACHKA PW, 1988, COMP BIOCHEM PHYS B, V90, P515, DOI 10.1016/0305-0491(88)90290-8; HOCHACHKA PW, 1986, SCIENCE, V231, P234, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.2417316; HOFFMANN AA, 1989, BIOL J LINN SOC, V37, P117, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8312.1989.TB02098.X; HOFFMANN AA, 1989, GENETICS, V122, P837; HOMER WS., 1930, J BIOL CHEM, V88, P97; ISAAC NJB, 2013, GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR, V22, P1, DOI 10.1111/J.1466-8238.2012.00782.X; ISAAC NJB, 2011, BIOL LETTERS, V7, P615, DOI 10.1098/RSBL.2011.0128; KILLEN SS, 2016, AM NAT, V187, P592, DOI 10.1086/685893; KILLEN SS, 2010, ECOL LETT, V13, P184, DOI 10.1111/J.1461-0248.2009.01415.X; KING RB, 2002, FUNCT ECOL, V16, P766, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-2435.2002.00678.X; LAWTON JH, 1999, OIKOS, V84, P177, DOI 10.2307/3546712; LIGHTON JRB, 2001, J EXP BIOL, V204, P607; LOEUILLE N, 2006, ECOL LETT, V9, P171, DOI 10.1111/J.1461-0248.2005.00861.X; LOTKA AJ, 1922, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V8, P147, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.8.6.147; LOVEGROVE BG, 2003, J COMP PHYSIOL B, V173, P87, DOI 10.1007/S00360-002-0309-5; LOVEGROVE BG, 2000, AM NAT, V156, P201, DOI 10.1086/303383; MCGILL BJ, 2006, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V21, P178, DOI 10.1016/J.TREE.2006.02.002; MCKENZIE DJ, 1996, COMP BIOCHEM PHYS A, V114, P43, DOI 10.1016/0300-9629(95)02086-1; MEREDITH A.

OXYGEN CONSUMPTION OF POST-LARVAL GALAXIAS MACULATUS WAS MEASURED IN RESPIROMETRY TRIALS UNDER DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES (5-21 DEGREES C) AND VARYING BODY MASSES (0.1->1.5G) SPANNING A RELEVANT RANGE OF THERMAL CONDITIONS AND SIZES. SPECIFIC RESPIRATION RATES (R IN G O-2 G(-1) D(-1)) DECLINED AS A POWER FUNCTION OF BODY MASS AND INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY WITH TEMPERATURE AND WAS EXPRESSED AS: R=0.0007 * W-0.31 * E(0.13 * T). THE ABILITY OF THIS MODEL TO PREDICT SPECIFIC RESPIRATION RATE WAS EVALUATED BY COMPARING OBSERVED VALUES WITH THOSE PREDICTED BY THE MODEL. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE RESPIRATION RATE OF G.

LANDSCAPE-SCALE CLINES IN ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS CAN LEAD TO LIFE-HISTORY GRADIENTS. STUDY OF INTERSPECIFIC LIFE-HISTORY DIFFERENCES CAN PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTATIONS IN RESPONSE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CUES, WHEREAS EXAMINATION OF INTRASPECIFIC LIFE-HISTORY VARIATION CAN IDENTIFY THE ECOLOGICAL MECHANISMS DRIVING TRAIT EVOLUTION. 2. WE EXAMINED EGG SIZE AND FECUNDITY VARIATION IN THREE SPECIES OF CLOSELY RELATED FRESHWATER FISH (GALAXIIDAE) WHICH OCCUR ACROSS A HABITAT GRADIENT IN SOUTH ISLAND, NEW ZEALAND. INTER-POPULATION TRAIT VARIATION WAS ASSESSED IN THE SPECIES WITH THE WIDEST DISTRIBUTION TO INVESTIGATE THE ECOLOGICAL MECHANISMS DRIVING EGG SIZE EVOLUTION. 3. SUBSTANTIAL INTERSPECIFIC EGG SIZE AND FECUNDITY DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED. GALAXIAS PAUCISPONDYLUS, WHICH GENERALLY OCCURS IN HIGH ALTITUDE HEADWATER STREAMS, SHOWED AN AVERAGE EGG SIZE AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE LARGER, AND FECUNDITY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE LOWER THAN G. BREVIPINNIS, A SPECIES WHICH REARS IN PELAGIC ENVIRONMENTS. GALAXIAS VULGARIS, WHICH REARS FLUVIAL ENVIRONMENTS BUT IS GENERALLY DISTRIBUTED IN LOWER CATCHMENT REACHES THAN G. PAUCISPONDYLUS, SHOWED INTERMEDIATE FECUNDITY AND EGG SIZE TRAITS. THIS INTERSPECIFIC TRAIT VARIATION IS LIKELY TO BE DRIVEN BY DIFFERENCES IN THE LARVAL REARING HABITAT, I.E. REARING IN COLD HIGH ALTITUDE LOCATIONS REQUIRES LARGE WELL-DEVELOPED LARVAE (AND THEREFORE LARGE EGGS) BUT THESE COME AT THE COST OF MATERNAL FECUNDITY, WHEREAS IN REARING IN WARMER LOWER CATCHMENT WATERCOURSES, AND PELAGIC HABITATS, DOES NOT REQUIRE SUCH LARGE WELL-DEVELOPED LARVAE. HENCE, FITNESS IS MAXIMISED BY PROGRESSIVELY INCREASING FECUNDITY BY REDUCING EGG SIZE ACROSS THIS HABITAT CLINE. 4. LIFE HISTORY-HABITAT TRENDS WERE REPEATED WHEN INTRASPECIFIC PATTERNS IN THE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED G. VULGARIS WERE ASSESSED, WITH POPULATION EGG SIZE INCREASING, AND FECUNDITY DECREASING, IN RELATION TO A SUITE OF INTERRELATED ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES UP AN APPROXIMATE ALTITUDINAL CLINE. 5. THE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT HOW INTER-AND INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION IN EGG SIZE-FECUNDITY TRADE-OFFS IN CLOSELY RELATED SPECIES CAN INTERACT TO DRIVE THE EVOLUTION OF LANDSCAPE-SCALE LIFE-HISTORY GRADIENTS. EGG SIZE DIFFERENCES ARE LIKELY TO BE DRIVEN BY DIFFERENCES IN THE QUALITY OF THE LARVAL REARING HABITAT, I.E. REARING IN A CHALLENGING HABITAT REQUIRES A LARGER EGG WHEREAS IN RELATIVELY BENIGN LARVAL REARING HABITAT, FECUNDITY CAN BE MAXIMISED BY REDUCING EGG SIZE. THE INTERSPECIFIC VARIATION OBSERVED PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF TRAIT ADAPTATION IN RESPONSE TO AN ENVIRONMENTAL CUE, WHILE THE INTRASPECIFIC INTER-POPULATION DIFFERENCES INDICATE THE POTENTIAL ECOLOGICAL MECHANISMS DRIVING TRAIT EVOLUTION.","ALCARAZ C, 2007, BIOL CONSERV, V139, P83, DOI 10.1016/J.BIOCON.2007.06.006; ALLIBONE RM, 2000, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V34, P593, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2000.9516960; BAGENAL TB, 1969, J FISH BIOL, V1, P167, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8649.1969.TB03850.X; BASU BK, 1996, LIMNOL OCEANOGR, V41, P1572; BAUR B, 1988, J ANIM ECOL, V57, P71, DOI 10.2307/4764; BEARS H, 2009, J ANIM ECOL, V78, P365, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2656.2008.01491.X; BIGGS BJF, 1987, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V21, P175, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1987.9516214; BIGGS BJF, 1995, FRESHWATER BIOL, V33, P419, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2427.1995.TB00404.X; BLAXTER JHS, 1992, NETH J ZOOL, V42, P336, DOI 10.1163/156854291X00379; BURGER DF, 2002, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V479, P31, DOI 10.1023/A:1021064111587; BURRIDGE CP, 2012, J BIOGEOGR, V39, P306, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2699.2011.02600.X; CADBURY SL, 2011, ECOHYDROLOGY, V4, P520, DOI 10.1002/ECO.185; CADWALLADER PL, 1976, J FISH BIOL, V8, P157, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8649.1976.TB03929.X; CLOSS GP, 2013, FRESHWATER BIOL, V58, P1162, DOI 10.1111/FWB.12116; CUSHING CE, 1964, ECOLOGY, V45, P306, DOI 10.2307/1933843; DEATH RG, 2005, OIKOS, V111, P392, DOI 10.1111/J.0030-1299.2005.13799.X; DUNN NICHOLAS R., 2007, NEW ZEALAND NATURAL SCIENCES, V32, P13; EINUM S, 2000, EVOLUTION, V54, P628, DOI 10.1111/J.0014-3820.2000.TB00064.X; EINUM S, 1999, P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI, V266, P2095, DOI 10.1098/RSPB.1999.0893; ETTER RJ, 1989, ECOLOGY, V70, P1857, DOI 10.2307/1938118; FAUSCH KD, 2002, BIOSCIENCE, V52, P483, DOI 10.1641/0006-3568(2002)0520483:LTRBTG2.0.CO;2; FENZ, 2014, FRESHW EC NZ FENZ GE; GOTO A, 2015, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V98, P307, DOI 10.1007/S10641-014-0262-7; GRANT P.

THUS, IT OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF STRONG SEASONAL VARIATION. THE ENERGY ALLOCATION PATTERN ON A DIADROMOUS POPULATION OF THE SPECIES AND THE INFLUENCE OF `WINTER' (4 DEGREES C, LIGHT:DARK PHOTOPERIOD OF 7:17) AND `SUMMER' (10 DEGREES C, LIGHT:DARK PHOTOPERIOD OF 17:7) EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS ON THE BIOENERGETICS OF THE SPECIES WERE STUDIED USING BOTH PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL INDICATORS. SOMATIC GROWTH, ENERGY DENSITY, FOOD CONSUMPTION, OXIDATIVE METABOLISM AND OXYGEN CONSUMPTION WERE MEASURED. IN WILD CONDITIONS, SUMMER AND WINTER WERE THE MORE `ENERGY DEMANDING' SEASONS, LEADING TO THE LOWEST ENERGY DENSITY OF INDIVIDUALS. SAME LEVELS OF FOOD CONSUMPTION WERE FOUND BOTH IN WILD AND `SUMMER' AND `WINTER' EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS. MOREOVER, BASAL METABOLISM DID NOT DIFFER UNDER EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS, HOWEVER, UNDER `WINTER' EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS INDIVIDUALS DID NOT GROW AND DIMINISHED THEIR SOMATIC CONDITION AND ENERGY RESERVES. THEREFORE, DURING WINTER THIS POPULATION WOULD NOT LOWER ENERGY DEMANDS (AS EXPECTED BY TEMPERATURE) WITH NO CHANGES IN METABOLIC RATES, BUT WITH THE CONSEQUENT LOWER GROSS CONVERSION EFFICIENCY, THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF GROWTH IN LENGTH, MASS AND MUSCLE, AND THE DEPLETION OF ENERGY RESERVES. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST A MECHANISM FOR METABOLIC DEMANDS, I.E. POSTPRANDIAL INCREASE IN O-2 CONSUMPTION (SDA) INDEPENDENT OF THE AMOUNT OF INGESTED FOOD, RELOCATING ENERGY RESERVES TO FUEL WINTER COSTS IN G. MACULATUS. THESE RESULTS PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF DIFFERENT ENERGY ALLOCATION STRATEGIES FOR WINTER AND SUMMER. A HIGHER PROPORTION OF ENERGY COULD BE DIRECTED TO GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION IN SUMMER, AND TO ACTIVITY SUPPORT IN WINTER. (C) 2016 ELSEVIER B.V.

UNTIL RECENTLY, TECHNIQUES WERE LACKING TO INVESTIGATE THE PREVALENCE AND VARIETY OF LIFE-HISTORY STRATEGIES. HOWEVER, RECENT TECHNICAL ADVANCES, SUCH AS OTOLITH TRACE ELEMENT AND STABLE ISOTOPE ANALYSES, HAVE PROVIDED INSIGHTS INTO THE LIFE-HISTORIES OF MIGRATORY FISH, OFTEN REVEALING CONSIDERABLE PLASTICITY. REVIEWS OF ANADROMY AND CATADROMY EXAMINED THE EXTENT OF PLASTICITY IN THESE LIFE-HISTORIES; HOWEVER AMPHIDROMY HAS NOT BEEN REVIEWED. AMPHIDROMY, THE MOST WIDESPREAD DIADROMOUS LIFE-HISTORY (273 + SP.), CONSISTS OF TWO TYPES: FRESHWATER AMPHIDROMY, WHERE FISH REAR IN THE OCEAN AS LARVAE AND RETURN TO FRESHWATER AS JUVENILES FOR GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION, AND MARINE AMPHIDROMY, WHERE FISH UTILIZE THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT FOR LARVAL GROWTH, ENTER FRESHWATER FOR A SHORT TIME, AND RETURN TO THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT FOR FURTHER GROWTH AND SPAWNING. IN THIS REVIEW, A DETAILED TAXONOMIC EXAMINATION OF PLASTICITY IN AMPHIDROMOUS FISHES IS UTILIZED TO DETERMINE ITS PREVALENCE AND ECOLOGICAL ROLE. OUR RESULTS INDICATE PLASTICITY, AS EVIDENCED BY VARIABLE USE OF FRESH OR MARINE ENVIRONMENTS FOR KEY LIFE-HISTORY STAGES, IS PRESENT ON BOTH EVOLUTIONARY AND ECOLOGICAL SCALES IN MOST FAMILIES OF AMPHIDROMOUS FISHES.

HOWEVER, AMPHIDROMOUS MIGRATIONS (FISH HATCH IN STREAMS, IMMEDIATELY MIGRATE TO THE SEA FOR A FEEDING PERIOD AND RETURN TO FRESH WATER AS JUVENILES) REMAIN UNDERSTUDIED OWING TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF TRACKING TINY LARVAL FISH. DESPITE THIS, IT HAS WIDELY BEEN ASSUMED THAT AMPHIDROMOUS FISH HAVE OPEN, RESILIENT POPULATIONS, WITH MARINE-REARING LARVAE DISPERSING WIDELY DURING THEIR PELAGIC PHASE. IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT WHEN AN ALTERNATIVE FRESHWATER PELAGIC HABITAT IS AVAILABLE, NON-DIADROMOUS RECRUITMENT WILL BE THE DOMINANT PROCESS IN SUSTAINING AMPHIDROMOUS FISH POPULATIONS, WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR THEIR CONNECTIVITY AND RESILIENCE. OTOLITH MICROCHEMICAL ANALYSES OF FIVE SPECIES (THREE GALAXIAS (GALAXIIDAE), TWO GOBIOMORPHUS (ELEOTRIDAE)) FROM PAIRED SYSTEMS ON THE SOUTH ISLAND OF NEW ZEALAND INDICATED THAT WHEN A SUITABLE FRESHWATER PELAGIC HABITAT EXISTED DOWNSTREAM, NON-DIADROMOUS RECRUITMENT WAS THE PRIMARY POPULATION-SUSTAINING PROCESS, TYPICALLY CONTRIBUTING >90\% OF RECRUITS. IN ADDITION, NOT ALL SPECIES RECRUITED FROM ALL LAKES, INDICATING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LARGELY UNSTUDIED ROLE OF SPECIES-SPECIFIC AMPHIDROMOUS LARVAL REQUIREMENTS. THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY EMPHASISE THE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS OF INDIVIDUAL POPULATIONS OF AMPHIDROMOUS FISH, AND HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING SPECIES-SPECIFIC EARLY LIFE HISTORY REQUIREMENTS TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THEIR DISTRIBUTIONS AND MANAGEMENT NEEDS.","ALLIBONE RM, 1993, BIOL J LINN SOC, V50, P19, DOI 10.1006/BIJL.1993.1045; AUGSPURGER JM, 2017, REV FISH BIOL FISHER, V27, P177, DOI 10.1007/S11160-016-9463-9; BERREBI P, 2005, MAR BIOL, V148, P179, DOI 10.1007/S00227-005-0058-6; BJORNN T.

EGGS DEVELOP TERRESTRIALLY AS WITH SEVERAL OTHER TELEOST FISHES. SPAWNING HABITAT OCCURS IN SPECIFIC LOCATIONS NEAR RIVERMOUTHS AND ITS PROTECTION IS A CONSERVATION PRIORITY. HOWEVER, QUANTIFYING THE AREAS INVOLVED IS HAMPERED BY HIGH EGG MORTALITY RATES ON DEGRADED WATERWAY MARGINS. WE HYPOTHESISED THAT TEMPORARY ARTIFICIAL HABITAT WOULD DETECT SPAWNING IN THESE SITUATIONS PRODUCING A USEFUL INDICATOR FOR RIPARIAN MANAGEMENT. WE INSTALLED ARRAYS OF STRAW BALES AS ARTIFICIAL HABITAT IN TWO INDEPENDENT EXPERIMENTS OVER CONSECUTIVE YEARS AND ASSESSED THEIR IMPACT USING PAIRWISE BEFORE-AFTER-CONTROL-IMPACT (BACI) EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS. WE TESTED DEGRADED GAPS WITHIN THE DISTRIBUTION OF KNOWN SPAWNING SITES AND ALSO AREAS FURTHER UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM. NINE SPAWNING OCCURRENCES WERE RECORDED ON ARTIFICIAL HABITATS IN 2015, 22 IN 2016, AND TWO ON PAIRED CONTROLS. BOTH EXPERIMENTS PRODUCED A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT FOR ARTIFICIAL HABITATS DEPLOYED IN DEGRADED GAPS WITHIN THE KNOWN SPAWNING SITE DISTRIBUTION (P = 0.0001) PROVIDING EVIDENCE THAT THESE LOCATIONS SHOULD BE REGARDED AS ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SPAWNING SITES. IN 2016 THE TECHNIQUE ALSO PRODUCED A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT DOWNSTREAM OF KNOWN SITES IN ONE OF THE STUDY CATCHMENTS (P = 0.0375). WE BELIEVE THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL HABITATS AS A DETECTION TOOL COULD BE USEFUL IN A VARIETY OF MANAGEMENT CONTEXTS. THESE INCLUDE IDENTIFYING AREAS FOR PROTECTION, AS CONFIRMATION OF SITE SUITABILITY PRIOR TO MAKING RESTORATION INVESTMENTS, AND IN INVESTIGATIONS TO SUPPORT THE MIGRATION OF HABITATS TO NEW LOCATIONS UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE, SINCE THESE MAY CURRENTLY BE DEGRADED.","BARBEE NC, 2011, MAR FRESHWATER RES, V62, P790, DOI 10.1071/MF10284; BATES D, 2015, J STAT SOFTW, V67, P1, DOI 10.18637/JSS.V067.I01; BEAVAN J, 2012, NEW ZEAL J GEOL GEOP, V55, P207, DOI 10.1080/00288306.2012.697472; BENZIE V., 1968, PROCEEDINGS OF THE NEW ZEALAND ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY, VNO. 15, P31; BERRA TM, 1996, MAR FRESHWATER RES, V47, P845, DOI 10.1071/MF9960845; BOLKER BM, 2009, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V24, P127, DOI 10.1016/J.TREE.2008.10.008; BOWIE MH, 2014, NEW ZEAL J ECOL, V38, P132; BULLERI F, 2008, ENVIRON CONSERV, V35, P11, DOI 10.1017/S037689290800458X; BURROWS MT, 2014, NATURE, V507, P492, DOI 10.1038/NATURE12976; CHRISTCHURCH CITY COUNCIL, 2016, OP HEATHC RIV CATCHM, P87; ENCINA-MONTOYA F, 2011, AQUAC RES, V42, P835, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2109.2010.02692.X; FRANKLIN PA, 2015, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V49, P419, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2015.1045004; GOODMAN J.

HERE, WE USED A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS TO TEST PREFERENCES OF G. MACULATUS FOR EGG LAYING IN COMBINATIONS OF A NATIVE SEDGE AND RUSH, AND TWO EXOTIC GRASSES. IN LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS, G. MACULATUS SPAWNED IN ALL AVAILABLE HABITATS WITH NO PREFERENCE FOR NATIVE OVER EXOTIC VEGETATION. EGG SURVIVAL DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN THE VEGETATIVE HABITATS, BUT IN A TREATMENT WHERE ONLY RIVER STONES WERE AVAILABLE, EGGS WERE LAID BUT THEY DEHYDRATED AND DIED. IN A FIELD EXPERIMENT, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE FOR A PREFERENCE FOR SPAWNING IN NATIVE VEGETATION, AND NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN A KEY FEATURE OF VEGETATIONTILLER DENSITYAND THE NUMBER OF EGGS LAID. THE MICROCLIMATE BENEATH DENSE VEGETATION IN EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS WAS MORE CONSTANT THAN AMBIENT CONDITIONS WITH FEW EXTREME TEMPERATURES AND LOW HUMIDITIES. GIVEN THE READINESS OF G.

THE CONSEQUENCES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES FOR PATAGONIAN FISH POPULATIONS VARY ACCORDING TO THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SPECIES CONSIDERED. SEVERAL PREVIOUSLY PREDICTED FACTS SUCH AS EXTIRPATIONS, EXTINCTIONS, AND TRANSLOCATIONS HAVE OCCURRED AND HUMAN ACTIONS SUCH AS TRANSPORT, INTRODUCTION, AND STOCKING OF EXOTIC SPECIES SUGGEST A MORE COMPLEX FUTURE. WE DISCUSS THE HISTORICAL BIOGEOGRAPHY OF PATAGONIAN FRESHWATER ICHTHYOFAUNA TO HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR PRESENT ADAPTATIONS AND PHYSIOLOGICAL ECOLOGY. WE ALSO ADDRESS POTENTIAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE AND PROCESSES SUCH AS MIGRATION, SPECIES INTRODUCTIONS, AND INVASIONS. THERE IS STILL MUCH TO LEARN FROM PATAGONIAN FISHES TO COMPREHEND HOW THESE SPECIES WILL ENDURE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES.","ABRAHAMS MARK, 2006, FISH PHYSIOLOGY, V24, P79; AIGO J., 2010, THESIS; AIGO J., 2014, SUSCEPTIBILITY NATIV, V816, P21; AIGO J, 2008, REV FISH BIOL FISHER, V18, P387, DOI 10.1007/S11160-007-9080-8; AIGO J, 2014, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V736, P73, DOI 10.1007/S10750-014-1888-3; CRICHIGNO SA, 2016, AQUAC RES, V47, P1797, DOI 10.1111/ARE.12638; CRICHIGNO SA, 2014, ZOOL ANZ, V253, P192, DOI 10.1016/J.JCZ.2013.12.002; ALLAN J.

TO DO THIS, WE ANALYSED THE CONCENTRATIONS OF DELTA S-34 IN VERTEBRAL COLUMN TISSUES FROM FISH COLLECTED IN TEN CHILEAN RIVER SYSTEMS ACROSS LATITUDES 36A DEGREES-47A DEGREES S. THE ANALYSES OF DELTA S-34 SIGNATURES IN THESE RIVERS SUGGEST THAT THE USE OF MARINE RESOURCES BY RIVERINE POPULATIONS OF G. MACULATUS IN LARGE RIVER SYSTEMS IN CHILE IS VARIABLE, WITH MARINE RESOURCES PLAYING A LIMITED ROLE IN MORE NORTHERN LARGE RIVERS, CHARACTERISED BY WARMER TEMPERATURES AND PREDICTABLE FLOW REGIMES AND FLOODPLAIN INUNDATIONS. THIS IS IN CONTRAST TO LIFE HISTORIES DESCRIBED FOR G.

OUR APPROACH IS DEMONSTRATED WITH A SURVEY OF THE HEATHCOTE/PWAHO FOLLOWING THE CANTERBURY EARTHQUAKES THAT PRODUCED UNEXPECTED FINDINGS. SPAWNING HABITAT WAS DETECTED OVER A 2.5KM REACH AND THE AREA OCCUPIED BY SPAWNING SITES (75M(2)) WAS MUCH LARGER THAN IN PREVIOUS RECORDS (CA.21M(2)). SITES DOMINATED BY THE INVASIVE PHALARIS ARUNDINACEAE WERE FOUND TO SUPPORT HIGH EGG NUMBERS. SPAWNING HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN RECORDED ON THIS SPECIES AND IT IS IDENTIFIED IN THE LITERATURE AS A THREAT TO SPAWNING HABITAT. CONSIDERABLE SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIATION WAS ALSO DETECTED IN THE LOCATION OF SPAWNING SITES AND PATTERN OF EGG PRODUCTION. TOGETHER, THESE ASPECTS ILLUSTRATE THE NEED FOR A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY METHODOLOGY TO RELIABLY QUANTIFY SPAWNING HABITAT. THE HEATHCOTE/PWAHO EXAMPLE SHOWS THE UTILITY OF OUR CENSUS APPROACH FOR ACHIEVING THIS, AND SUPPORTING HABITAT CONSERVATION OBJECTIVES.","BURNET A. M.

DESPITE THE WIDESPREAD INVESTIGATION OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FISH HABITAT USE AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES, THERE IS A PAUCITY OF KNOWLEDGE ON HOW ABIOTIC AND BIOTIC FACTORS JOINTLY INFLUENCE STREAM FISH HABITAT USE. THREE NEW ZEALAND SOUTH ISLAND STREAMS WERE SELECTED TO INVESTIGATE THE HABITAT PREFERENCE OF A STREAM-DWELLING GALAXIID, BANDED KOKOPU (GALAXIAS FASCIATUS). FISH ABUNDANCE IN SEVERAL PERMANENT POOLS WAS DETERMINED BY SPOTLIGHTING AT NIGHT ONCE A MONTH FROM JUNE 2008 TO MAY 2009. DRIFTING INVERTEBRATES AND KEY PHYSICAL FEATURES OF EACH POOL WERE MEASURED AT THE TIME OF FISH SAMPLING. AN INFORMATION-THEORETIC APPROACH (AIC) INDICATED THAT THE MOST PARSIMONIOUS CANDIDATE MODEL TO PREDICT BANDED KOKOPU BIOMASS WAS THE ONE THAT INCLUDED POOL AREA, UNDERCUT BANKS, WATER VELOCITY, OVERHANGING VEGETATION, INVERTEBRATE DRIFT DENSITY AND AN INTERACTION TERM BETWEEN INVERTEBRATE DRIFT DENSITY AND WATER VELOCITY. BANDED KOKOPU BIOMASS WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO POOL AREA, UNDERCUT BANKS, OVERHANGING VEGETATION AND INVERTEBRATE DRIFT DENSITY. OUR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT FISH RESOURCE USE PATTERNS NEED TO BE UNDERSTOOD IN THE CONTEXT OF MULTIPLE INTERACTING ECOLOGICAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PREY ABUNDANCE.","AKBARIPASAND A, 2011, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V45, P135, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2010.544044; AKBARIPASAND A., 2012, THESIS; AKBARIPASAND A, 2014, OECOLOGIA, V176, P771, DOI 10.1007/S00442-014-3038-Z; AKBARIPASAND A, 2014, FRESHW SCI, V33, P904, DOI 10.1086/676957; ALLIBONE R, 2010, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V44, P271, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2010.514346; AYLLON D, 2009, RIVER RES APPL, V25, P1051, DOI 10.1002/RRA.1215; BAKER CF, 2007, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V41, P25, DOI 10.1080/00288330709509893; BONNETT M.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS RESPONSE DEPENDS ON THE HOST SPECIES. DURING A SURVEY OF PARASITES OF THE NATIVE FISH, GALAXIAS MACULATUS, WE FOUND CONSPICUOUS, STRONGLY MELANIZED EXTERIOR CYSTS LOCATED IN THE CAUDAL PEDUNCLE OF THE FISH. DISSECTION OF THESE CYSTS EXPOSED LARVAL NEMATODES WHOSE MORPHOMETRICAL FEATURES ALLOWED THEIR IDENTIFICATION AS EUSTRONGYLIDES SP. SPECIES OF THIS GENUS ARE DISTRIBUTED WORLDWIDE. GALAXIAS MACULATUS WAS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AS SECOND INTERMEDIATE HOST TO EUSTRONGYLIDES SP. LARVAE, AND THE AQUATIC BIRD PODICEPS MAJOR WAS CITED AS DEFINITIVE HOST OF EUSTRONGYLIDES TUBIFEX IN ANDEAN PATAGONIAN LAKES. THE SITE OF INFECTION IN THE FISH, AND THE HOSTS RESPONSE ARE UNIQUE AMONG INFECTIONS BY LARVAE OF EUSTRONGYLIDES SP. IN FISHES, SO THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DESCRIBE THE HISTOLOGICAL INJURY CAUSED BY LARVAE OF THE GENUS EUSTRONGYLIDES PARASITIZING G. MACULATUS. SAMPLES OF FISH WERE TAKEN NEAR THE SHORE OF GUTIERREZ LAKE, IN NORTHWESTERN PATAGONIA. SOME LARVAL MORPHOMETRIC FEATURES WERE DESCRIBED TO CONFIRM THE IDENTITY OF LARVAE TO GENERIC LEVEL. HISTOPATHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS (TISSUES SECTIONED AT 5-7 MU M, STAINED WITH HEMATOXYLIN AND EOSIN, AND MASSON'S TRICHROME) OF THE CAUDAL PEDUNCLE REVEALED ALMOST COMPLETE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE EPAXIAL MUSCULATURE DUE TO COMPRESSIVE ATROPHY AND A CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE, ASSOCIATED MAINLY WITH A DENSE FIBROTIC CAPSULE AND AN INTENSE MELANIC DEPOSIT. THIS IS THE FIRST DESCRIPTION OF THE HISTOPATHOLOGY OF AN EXTERNAL CYST CAUSED BY EUSTRONGYLIDES SP.

WHILE DIADROMY MAY PROMOTE GENE FLOW LEADING TO A LACK OF GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION AMONG POPULATIONS, RESIDENT POPULATIONS TEND TO BE AFFECTED BY LOCAL ADAPTATION AND/OR PLASTICITY. STUDIES ON THESE EFFECTS ON GENOMIC DIVERGENCE IN NONMODEL AMPHIDROMOUS SPECIES ARE SCARCE. GALAXIAS MACULATUS, ONE OF THE MOST WIDESPREAD FISH SPECIES IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE, EXHIBITS TWO LIFE HISTORIES, AN ANCESTRAL DIADROMOUS, SPECIFICALLY, AMPHIDROMOUS FORM, AND A DERIVED FRESHWATER RESIDENT FORM. WE EXAMINED THE GENETIC DIVERSITY AND DIVERGENCE AMONG 20 ESTUARINE AND RESIDENT POPULATIONS ACROSS THE CHILEAN DISTRIBUTION OF G. MACULATUS AND ASSESSED THE EXTENT TO WHICH SELECTION IS INVOLVED IN THE DIFFERENTIATION AMONG RESIDENT POPULATIONS. WE OBTAINED NEARLY 4,400 SNP MARKERS USING A RADCAP APPROACH FOR 224 INDIVIDUALS. AS EXPECTED, COLLECTIONS FROM ESTUARINE LOCATIONS TYPICALLY CONSIST OF DIADROMOUS INDIVIDUALS. DIADROMOUS POPULATIONS ARE HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED FROM THEIR RESIDENT COUNTERPARTS BY BOTH NEUTRAL AND PUTATIVE ADAPTIVE MARKERS. WHILE DIADROMOUS POPULATIONS EXHIBIT HIGH GENE FLOW AND LACK SITE FIDELITY, RESIDENT POPULATIONS APPEAR TO BE THE PRODUCT OF DIFFERENT COLONIZATION EVENTS WITH RELATIVELY LOW GENETIC DIVERSITY AND VARYING LEVELS OF GENE FLOW. IN PARTICULAR, THE NORTHERNMOST RESIDENT POPULATIONS WERE CLEARLY GENETICALLY DISTINCT AND REPRODUCTIVELY ISOLATED FROM EACH OTHER SUGGESTING LOCAL ADAPTATION. OUR STUDY PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO THE ROLE OF LIFE HISTORY DIFFERENCES IN THE MAINTENANCE OF GENETIC DIVERSITY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF GENETIC DIVERGENCE IN SPECIES EVOLUTION.","ALEXANDER DH, 2009, GENOME RES, V19, P1655, DOI 10.1101/GR.094052.109;

DESPITE THIS, THE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF AMPHIDROMOUS SPECIES IS EXCEPTIONALLY CHALLENGING BECAUSE THIS LIFE HISTORY TYPE, WITH LARVAL DEVELOPMENT IN A PELAGIC HABITAT (USUALLY MARINE) AND ADULT DEVELOPMENT IN FRESH WATER, IS POORLY RESOLVED. THE CHRONOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF OTOLITHS, TOGETHER WITH A SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF POST-LARVAL MIGRATION TRAITS AND ADULT REPRODUCTIVE TRAITS, WERE USED TO RECONSTRUCT THE LIFE HISTORY OF A WIDESPREAD, YET DECLINING AMPHIDROMOUS GALAXIID, GALAXIAS MACULATUS, AND TO EXPLORE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MARINE AND FRESHWATER LIFE PHASES. A WIDE RANGE OF POST-LARVAL MIGRATION TRAITS WERE OBSERVED OVER THE PEAK MIGRATORY PERIOD. POST-LARVAE WERE SMALLER AND YOUNGER AT INWARD MIGRATION LATE IN THE MIGRATION SEASON (NOVEMBER) AND WERE DERIVED FROM WINTER SPAWNING EVENTS. EARLIER MIGRANTS (SEPTEMBER) WERE LARGER, OLDER AND DERIVED FROM AUTUMN SPAWNING EVENTS. AGE ESTIMATES CONFIRMED THAT G. MACULATUS IS LARGELY AN ANNUAL SPECIES, BUT BACK-CALCULATED HATCH DATES SHOWED THAT SPAWNING TIMES ARE MORE EXTENSIVE THAN PREVIOUSLY KNOWN. GROWTH RECONSTRUCTIONS REVEALED THAT WINTER-HATCHED LARVAE WERE FASTER GROWING DURING MARINE AND FRESHWATER LIFE AND ATTAINED SEXUAL MATURITY AT A YOUNGER AGE THAN AUTUMN-HATCHED FISH. HOWEVER, NO DIFFERENCES IN BODY SIZE OR REPRODUCTIVE INVESTMENT WERE DETECTED BETWEEN AUTUMN- AND WINTER-HATCHED LARVAE. THE FIRST 50 DAYS OF MARINE GROWTH WERE INTER-DEPENDENT, INDICATING THAT EARLY LARVAL GROWTH MAY BE THE CRITICAL LINK TO UNDERSTANDING INTRA- AND INTER-ANNUAL RECRUITMENT VARIATIONS OF INWARD MIGRATING POST-LARVAE. FURTHERMORE, GROWTH AFTER 60 DAYS OF LARVAL LIFE PROPAGATED THROUGH TO ADULT FRESHWATER DEVELOPMENT, HIGHLIGHTING LINKAGES BETWEEN LATE MARINE AND ADULT FRESHWATER LIFE. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE VALUE OF STUDYING THE MARINE AND FRESHWATER LIFE PHASES OF AMPHIDROMOUS SPECIES IN TANDEM. THIS INTERCONNECTED UNDERSTANDING MUST ULTIMATELY BE ACHIEVED FOR THE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF SPECIES WITH THIS POORLY UNDERSTOOD LIFE HISTORY TYPE.","AUGSPURGER JM, 2017, REV FISH BIOL FISHER, V27, P177, DOI 10.1007/S11160-016-9463-9; BEGER M, 2010, BIOL CONSERV, V143, P565, DOI 10.1016/J.BIOCON.2009.11.006; BELL KNI, 1995, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V52, P1535, DOI 10.1139/F95-147; BROPHY D, 2002, ICES J MAR SCI, V59, P1305, DOI 10.1006/JMSC.2002.1304; BURNHAM K.P., 2002, MODEL SELECTION MULT; CAMPANA SE, 1985, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V42, P1014, DOI 10.1139/F85-127; CASTELLANOS-GALINDO GA, 2011, CYBIUM, V35, P391; CHISWELL SM, 2015, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V49, P286, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2014.992918; CLOSS GP, 2013, FRESHWATER BIOL, V58, P1162, DOI 10.1111/FWB.12116; FRANKLIN PA, 2015, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V49, P419, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2015.1045004; FRIEDLAND KD, 1996, FISH B-NOAA, V94, P654; GORSKI K, 2018, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V814, P61, DOI 10.1007/S10750-015-2542-4; GROSS MR, 1988, SCIENCE, V239, P1291, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.239.4845.1291; HA PY, 1996, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V45, P383, DOI 10.1007/BF00002531; HALE R, 2008, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V354, P229, DOI 10.3354/MEPS07251; HEIM KC, 2016, ECOL FRESHW FISH, V25, P156, DOI 10.1111/EFF.12199; HICKFORD MJH, 2016, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V548, P197, DOI 10.3354/MEPS11701; HICKFORD MJH, 2011, OECOLOGIA, V166, P131, DOI 10.1007/S00442-010-1834-7; HICKS AS, 2017, MAR FRESHWATER RES, V68, P2315, DOI 10.1071/MF16387; HOAREAU TB, 2007, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V333, P303, DOI 10.3354/MEPS333303; HOGAN JD, 2014, ECOLOGY, V95, P2397, DOI 10.1890/13-0576.1; HUGHEY K.F.D., 2013, PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS N; IIDA M, 2013, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V96, P645, DOI 10.1007/S10641-012-0055-9; JONSSON N, 2007, J FISH BIOL, V71, P245, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8649.2007.01488.X; KEITH P, 2008, MAR FRESHWATER RES, V59, P876, DOI 10.1071/MF08116; KERR LA, 2010, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V89, P479, DOI 10.1007/S10641-010-9664-3; MARCO-RIUS F, 2013, PLOS ONE, V8, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0061744; MCDOWALL RM, 2007, FISH FISH, V8, P1, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-2979.2007.00232.X; MCDOWALL R.

INCORRECT ADAPTATION OF EARLY LIFE-HISTORY CHARACTERISTICS TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS WILL RESULT IN HIGH LARVAL MORTALITY AND THEREFORE RECRUITMENT FAILURE. AS A RESULT, UNDERSTANDING EARLY LIFE-HISTORY REQUIREMENTS IS CRITICAL IF CONSERVATION TECHNIQUES SUCH AS TRANSLOCATIONS ARE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. FOR AMPHIDROMOUS FISHES, LANDLOCKED AND MARINE REARING ENVIRONMENTS PRESENT FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT CHALLENGES, AND THUS EARLY LIFE HISTORY MUST BE ADAPTED TO ALLOW THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LANDLOCKED POPULATIONS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED GONADAL DEVELOPMENT TO DETERMINE SPAWNING TIME, EGG SIZE, AND FECUNDITY IN LANDLOCKED AND DIADROMOUS POPULATIONS OF THE THREATENED FISH GALAXIAS BREVIPINNIS TO ASSESS EARLY LIFE-HISTORY ADAPTATION TO FACULTATIVE AMPHIDROMY IN SOUTHERN NEW ZEALAND. RIPENING AND SPAWNING TIMES OF LANDLOCKED POPULATIONS WERE PROTRACTED COMPARED WITH DIADROMOUS POPULATIONS. DIADROMOUS POPULATIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY SPAWNED DURING A MARCH FLOOD, WHEREAS OVULATING LANDLOCKED INDIVIDUALS WERE FOUND FROM AUGUST TO DECEMBER, WITH A PEAK IN OCTOBER. OOCYTE SIZE IN LANDLOCKED INDIVIDUALS WAS APPROXIMATELY 25\% SMALLER THAN THAT IN DIADROMOUS POPULATIONS, AND THE FECUNDITY OF LANDLOCKED INDIVIDUALS WAS HIGHER THAN THAT FOR DIADROMOUS INDIVIDUALS. TRANSLOCATIONS OF LANDLOCKED INDIVIDUALS TO DIADROMOUS STOCKS ARE THEREFORE UNLIKELY TO BE SUCCESSFUL, WHEREAS THE LARGE EGG SIZE OF DIADROMOUS POPULATIONS WOULD ALLOW THE TRANSLOCATION OF DIADROMOUS STOCKS TO LANDLOCKED ENVIRONMENTS.","AUGSPURGER J.

MULTIPLE LINES OF EVIDENCE REVEAL THE CONTRIBUTION OF NON-DIADROMOUS RECRUITMENT FOR SUPPORTING ENDEMIC FISH POPULATIONS WITHIN NEW ZEALAND'S LONGEST RIVER,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,DEPTH PROFILING; GALAXIIDAE; LA-ICPMS; OTOLITH MICROCHEMISTRY; RECRUITMENT SOURCE; RESTORATION; RIVERSCAPE; STRONTIUM ISOTOPES,"OTOLITH MICROCHEMISTRY WAS USED TO IDENTIFY MARINE- VERSUS FRESHWATER-DERIVED RECRUITMENT OF THREE NATIVE FRESHWATER FISH SPECIES BELONGING TO THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE FAMILY GALAXIIDAE, IN NEW ZEALAND'S LONGEST RIVER SYSTEM, THE WAIKATO RIVER. WATER CHEMISTRY DATA FOR TRACE ELEMENTS AND SR-87/SR-86 ISOTOPE RATIOS WERE COLLECTED FROM FIVE LENTIC AND 10 LOTIC WATER BODIES THROUGHOUT THE LOWER RIVER FLOODPLAIN. POTENTIAL SPAWNING SITES FOR GALAXIIDS WERE COMPARED WITH VALUES OBTAINED BY LASER ABLATION INDUCTIVELY COUPLED MASS SPECTROMETRY (LA-ICPMS) DEPTH PROFILING OF YOUNG-OF-THE-YEAR OTOLITHS SAMPLED FROM FISH IN NINE LOWER RIVER CATCHMENT SITES. OTOLITH CHEMICAL SIGNATURES FROM THE LARVAL REARING PERIOD INDICATED THAT CATCHMENT-SCALE RECRUITMENT FOR TWO SPECIES, GALAXIAS ARGENTEUS (GMELIN, 1789) AND GALAXIAS FASCIATUS GRAY, 1842, WAS DRIVEN PREDOMINANTLY BY NON-DIADROMOUS RECRUITMENT FROM ONE LAKE (LAKE WAAHI). IN CONTRAST, DIADROMOUS RECRUITMENT APPEARED TO BE MORE COMMON FOR GALAXIAS MACULATUS (JENYNS, 1842); HOWEVER, NON-DIADROMOUS SPECIMENS WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM A NEW ZEALAND RIVER. REVERSING LAKE OUTLET FLOWS LINKED TO RIVER STAGE APPEARS BE IMPORTANT IN FACILITATING THE DISPERSAL OF RHEOTACTIC LARVAE OUT OF LAKES, SUGGESTING THAT LAKE OUTFLOW MANAGEMENT AT KEY TIMES COULD BE USED TO SUSTAIN THIS ECOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT FUNCTION. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THAT SOME WATER BODIES CAN SUPPLY A DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE NUMBER OF RECRUITS TO SUPPORT FISH POPULATIONS WITHIN THE WIDER RIVERSCAPE. IDENTIFYING THESE WATER BODIES AND MANAGING THEM TO SUSTAIN RECRUITMENT IS KEY TO THE CONSERVATION OF NON-DIADROMOUS GALAXIIDAE IN THIS MODIFIED LOWLAND ENVIRONMENT","AMTSTAETTER F, 2017, FISHERIES MANAG ECOL, V24, P186, DOI 10.1111/FME.12211; ANDERSON MJ, 2001, AUSTRAL ECOL, V26, P32, DOI 10.1046/J.1442-9993.2001.01070.X; ARCHITECTURE ENGINEERING CONSULTING OPERATIONS MAINTENANCE, 2016, ROT ICMP MAJ DRAIN P; AUGSPURGER J.

THIS HAS OBVIOUS BENEFITS FOR COLONIZATION AND CONNECTIVITY OF FRAGMENTED SUB-POPULATIONS, BUT REQUIRES A PHYSIOLOGICALLY CHALLENGING MIGRATION ACROSS A SALINITY BOUNDARY. WE CONSIDER THE ROLE OF LANDSCAPE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN FRESHWATER AND SEAWATER HABITATS, AND EVALUATE THEIR POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON TRAITS AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORIES OF LARVAE AND JUVENILES (I.E., DISPERSING LIFE-HISTORY STAGES) OF AN AMPHIDROMOUS FISH, GALAXIAS MACULATUS. WE SAMPLED JUVENILE FISH ON THEIR RETURN TO 20 RIVERS IN NEW ZEALAND: 10 RIVERS HAD ABRUPT TRANSITIONS TO THE SEA (I.E., EMPTYING TO AN OPEN COASTLINE); THESE WERE PAIRED WITH 10 NEARBY RIVERS THAT HAD GRADUAL TRANSITIONS TO THE SEA (I.E., EMPTYING INTO ESTUARINE EMBAYMENTS). WE RECONSTRUCTED INDIVIDUAL DISPERSAL HISTORIES USING OTOLITH MICROSTRUCTURE, OTOLITH MICROCHEMISTRY, AND STABLE ISOTOPE ANALYSIS. WE FOUND THAT FISH RECRUITING TO EMBAYMENT RIVERS HAD DISTINCT DISPERSAL AND FORAGING HISTORIES, WERE SLOWER GROWING, SMALLER IN SIZE, AND OLDER THAN FISH RECRUITING TO NEARBY NON-EMBAYMENT RIVERS. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT LANDSCAPE EDGES CAN AFFECT DISPERSAL CAPABILITIES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO DIVERGENT LIFE-HISTORY STRATEGIES (I.E., LIMITED- VERSUS WIDESPREAD-DISPERSAL). PATTERNS ALSO SUGGEST THAT DISPERSAL POTENTIAL AMONG LANDSCAPE BOUNDARIES CAN CREATE HETEROGENEITY IN THE TRAITS OF INDIVIDUALS, WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR METAPOPULATION DYNAMICS.","AUGSPURGER JM, 2017, REV FISH BIOL FISHER, V27, P177, DOI 10.1007/S11160-016-9463-9; BERRA TM, 1996, MAR FRESHWATER RES, V47, P845, DOI 10.1071/MF9960845; BOSTROM C, 2011, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V427, P191, DOI 10.3354/MEPS09051; BOWLER DE, 2005, BIOL REV, V80, P205, DOI 10.1017/S1464793104006645; BYSTRIANSKY JS, 2011, J EXP BIOL, V214, P2435, DOI 10.1242/JEB.050633; CADENASSO ML, 2003, BIOSCIENCE, V53, P750, DOI 10.1641/0006-3568(2003)0530750:AFFATO2.0.CO;2; CADENASSO ML, 2001, CONSERV BIOL, V15, P91, DOI 10.1046/J.1523-1739.2001.99309.X; CAMPANA SE, 2001, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V58, P30, DOI 10.1139/F00-177; CLOSS GP, 2013, FRESHWATER BIOL, V58, P1162, DOI 10.1111/FWB.12116; COWEN RK, 2000, SCIENCE, V287, P857, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.287.5454.857; CROZIER LG, 2008, EVOL APPL, V1, P252, DOI 10.1111/J.1752-4571.2008.00033.X; DUELLI P, 1990, BIOL CONSERV, V54, P193, DOI 10.1016/0006-3207(90)90051-P; EDELAAR P, 2017, AM NAT, V190, P506, DOI 10.1086/693345; FOGARTY MJ, 1993, ICES J MAR SCI, V50, P247, DOI 10.1006/JMSC.1993.1027; GRANTHAM BA, 2003, ECOL APPL, V13, PS108; GROOT C., 1991, PACIFIC SALMON LIFE; GROSS M.R., 1987, AM FISH SOC S, V1, P14; HEATH RA, 1985, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V19, P79, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1985.9516077; HEGG JC, 2013, OECOLOGIA, V172, P1017, DOI 10.1007/S00442-012-2564-9; HICKEY BM, 2003, ESTUARIES, V26, P1010, DOI 10.1007/BF02803360; HICKFORD MJH, 2016, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V548, P197, DOI 10.3354/MEPS11701; HICKS AS, 2017, MAR FRESHWATER RES, V68, P2315, DOI 10.1071/MF16387; HOGAN JD, 2014, ECOLOGY, V95, P2397, DOI 10.1890/13-0576.1; HUEY JA, 2014, FRESHWATER BIOL, V59, P1672, DOI 10.1111/FWB.12373; JOWETT IG, 1998, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V32, P307, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1998.9516827; KAEMINGK MA, 2014, T AM FISH SOC, V143, P845, DOI 10.1080/00028487.2014.886622; KEEFER ML, 2008, T AM FISH SOC, V137, P1120, DOI 10.1577/T07-008.1; LARGIER JL, 1993, ESTUARIES, V16, P1, DOI 10.2307/1352760; LIDICKER WZ, 1999, LANDSCAPE ECOL, V14, P333; MCCLELLAND JW, 1997, LIMNOL OCEANOGR, V42, P930, DOI 10.4319/LO.1997.42.5.0930; MCDOWALL RM, 2007, FISH FISH, V8, P1, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-2979.2007.00232.X; MCDOWALL RM, 2006, FISH FISH, V7, P153, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-2979.2006.00217.X; MCDOWALL RM, 2010, REV FISH BIOL FISHER, V20, P87, DOI 10.1007/S11160-009-9125-2; MCDOWALL RM, 1994, B MAR SCI, V54, P385; MCDOWALL RM, 1997, REV FISH BIOL FISHER, V7, P443, DOI 10.1023/A:1018404331601; MCDOWALL RM, 1980, ECOLOGY WHITEBAIT MI; MCDOWALL RM., 1984, NZ WHITEBAIT BOOK; MOODY KN, 2015, MOL ECOL, V24, P545, DOI 10.1111/MEC.13016; MURCIA C, 1995, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V10, P58, DOI 10.1016/S0169-5347(00)88977-6; NEILSON CSB, 2016, THESIS; NOONBURG EG, 2015, ECOLOGY, V96, P1159, DOI 10.1890/14-1531.1; POST DM, 2002, ECOLOGY, V83, P703, DOI 10.2307/3071875; QUINN GP, 2002, EXPT DESIGN DATA ANA; RIES L, 2004, ANNU REV ECOL EVOL S, V35, P491, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV.ECOLSYS.35.112202.130148; ROBINSON ROBERT A., 2009, ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH, V7, P87, DOI 10.3354/ESR00095; SHIMA JS, 2016, ECOLOGY, V97, P25, DOI 10.1890/14-2298.1; SHIMA JS, 2015, BIOL LETTERS, V11, DOI 10.1098/RSBL.2014.0778; SHIMA JS, 2010, J ANIM ECOL, V79, P1308, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2656.2010.01733.X; SHIMA JS, 2009, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V394, P223, DOI 10.3354/MEPS08298; SHIMA JS, 2009, ECOLOGY, V90, P1255, DOI 10.1890/08-0029.1; SLADE EM, 2013, ECOLOGY, V94, P1519, DOI 10.1890/12-1366.1; STEVENS JCB, 2016, J FISH BIOL, V89, P1931, DOI 10.1111/JFB.13083; STEVENS VM, 2010, PLOS ONE, V5, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0011123; SWEARER SE, 2002, B MAR SCI, V70, P251; WATERS JM, 2000, MOL ECOL, V9, P1815, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-294X.2000.01082.X; WOODROFFE R, 1998, SCIENCE, V280, P2126, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.280.5372.2126",10.1007/S00442-019-04440-X,2,NEW ZEALAND;AUSTRALIA;NEW ZEALAND;NEW ZEALAND,28,TERTIARY,VUW,NZ,"BOP, WELLINGTON, WAIKATO",N,Y,N,N,N,N,REGIONAL,530,N,NA,NA,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,NA,OTOLITH MICROCHEMISTRY,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DOCUMENT MIGRATORY LIFE HISTORIES OF NATIVE GALAXIIDS AND INTRODUCED SALMONIDS FROM A WIDE LATITUDINAL RANGE IN CHILEAN PATAGONIA (39-48 DEGREES S). OTOLITH MICROCHEMISTRY DATA WERE ANALYSED USING A RECURSIVE PARTITIONING APPROACH TO TEST FOR DIADROMY. BASED ON ANNULAR ANALYSIS OF SR:CA RATIOS, A DIADROMOUS LIFE HISTORY WAS SUGGESTED FOR POPULATIONS OF NATIVE APLOCHITON TAENIATUS, A. MARINUS, AND GALAXIAS MACULATUS. LIFETIME RESIDENCY IN FRESHWATER WAS SUGGESTED FOR POPULATIONS OF A. ZEBRA AND G. PLATEI. AMONG INTRODUCED SALMONIDS, POPULATIONS OF ONCORHYNCHUS TSHAWYTSCHA AND O. KISUTCH EXHIBITED PATTERNS CONSISTENT WITH ANADROMY, WHEREAS THE SCREENED POPULATION OF O. MYKISS APPEARED RESTRICTED TO FRESHWATER. SALMO TRUTTA EXHIBITED VARIABLE PATTERNS SUGGESTING FRESHWATER RESIDENCY AND POSSIBLY ANADROMY IN ONE CASE. THE CAPACITY AND GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT IS INCREASING AND MAY DISRUPT MIGRATORY ROUTES OF DIADROMOUS FISHES.

CLADOCERA HEAVILY DOMINATED G. MACULATUS DIET IN OCTOBER (74-97\%), PARTICULARLY AT THE UPPER SITE, WHICH WAS DOWNSTREAM OF A LAKE- AND WETLAND-FED TRIBUTARY INFLOW. THERE WERE GREATER PROPORTIONS OF THE CLADOCERANS BOSMINA AND DAPHNIA AND FEWER COPEPODA OR ROTIFERA IN GUTS COMPARED WITH RELATIVE ABUNDANCES IN RIVER WATER AT LOCATIONS WHERE FISH WERE CAUGHT DURING THE DAY. THESE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE POTENTIAL IMPORTANCE OF A RANGE OF FOODS ITEMS, IN PARTICULAR LARGE ZOOPLANKTON, TO THE DIET OF MIGRATORY JUVENILE G. MACULATUS, AND IMPLICATE OFF-CHANNEL HABITATS AS POTENTIAL SOURCES OF CLADOCERAN FOOD FOLLOWING SPRING HIGH FLOW EVENTS.","AMOROS C, 2002, FRESHWATER BIOL, V47, P761, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-2427.2002.00905.X; BLABER SJM, 1986, AUST J MAR FRESH RES, V37, P329; BOULTON A J, 1992, REGULATED RIVERS RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT, V7, P137, DOI 10.1002/RRR.3450070203; BROWN EDMUND, 2010, WATERS WAIKATO ECOLO, P29; BURGER DF, 2002, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V479, P31, DOI 10.1023/A:1021064111587; CATLIN AK, 2017, MAR FRESHWATER RES, V68, P76, DOI 10.1071/MF15273; CERVELLINI PM, 1993, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V36, P283, DOI 10.1007/BF00001724; CHAPMAN MA, 2011, GUIDE TO THE FRESHWATER CRUSTACEA OF NEW ZEALAND, P1; COLLIER KJ, 2013, RIVER RES APPL, V29, P1277, DOI 10.1002/RRA.2609; COLLIER KJ, 2008, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V42, P129, DOI 10.1080/00288330809509943; COLLIER KJ, 2010, WATERS WAIKATO ECOLO, P1; DE MEESTER L, 2007, OECOLOGIA, V153, P431, DOI 10.1007/S00442-007-0721-3; DE ROBERTIS A, 2003, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V60, P1517, DOI 10.1139/F03-123; DEVRIES DR, 1998, T AM FISH SOC, V127, P1040, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(1998)127<1040:PSBLFA>2.0.CO;2; GORSKI K., 2012, RIG211 CBER U WAIK; GORSKI K, 2013, FRESHWATER BIOL, V58, P1458, DOI 10.1111/FWB.12144; GRENOUILLET G, 2002, ECOGRAPHY, V25, P641, DOI 10.1034/J.1600-0587.2002.250601.X; HAMILTON D.

OTOLITH MICROCHEMISTRY HAS REVEALED A HIGH DEGREE OF LIFE HISTORY PLASTICITY IN MANY AMPHIDROMOUS SPECIES, WITH DIADROMOUS AND NON-DIADROMOUS RECRUITMENT OCCURRING. WE EXAMINED THIS PLASTICITY AND ITS EFFECT ON POPULATION STRUCTURE, DISPERSAL AND RECRUITMENT INGALAXIAS BREVIPINNIS, AN AMPHIDROMOUS FISH WIDESPREAD AROUND NEW ZEALAND. WE USED OTOLITH MICROCHEMISTRY ANALYSES TO EXAMINE RECRUITMENT SOURCES AND FISH SURVEYS TO ASSESS ABUNDANCE AND SIZE STRUCTURE IN TWO LARGE RIVER SYSTEMS, EACH CONTAINING NATURALLY FORMED LAKES AND NO OBVIOUS PHYSICAL BARRIERS TO MIGRATION. OTOLITH ANALYSES REVEALED DISCRETE RECRUITMENT SOURCES FOR STREAM-RESIDENT POPULATIONS, WITH MARINE RECRUITMENT SUPPORTING POPULATIONS DOWNSTREAM FROM LAKES AND EXCLUSIVELY LAKE-DERIVED RECRUITMENT FOR POPULATIONS UPSTREAM OF LAKES. ALTHOUGH DIADROMOUSG.

THEIR GENETIC PATTERNS HAVE BEEN STUDIED OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES TO DISENTANGLE HOW HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY PROCESSES INFLUENCED THEIR BIOGEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION AND PHYLOGEOGRAPHIC PATTERNS. HERE WE REVIEW AND SYNTHESIZE THIS BODY OF WORK. PHYLOGEOGRAPHIC APPROACHES REVEAL THE IMPORTANT ROLE PLAYED BY OROGENY AND THE EXPANSION/MELTING OF GLACIAL ICE DURING THE QUATERNARY. POPULATIONS RETREATED TO GLACIAL REFUGIA DURING GLACIAL TIMES AND SOME SYSTEMS EXPERIENCED DRAINAGE REVERSALS FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE PACIFIC FOLLOWING DEGLACIATION. ALTHOUGH MOST SPECIES EXPANDED THEIR POPULATIONS AND INCREASED THEIR GENETIC DIVERSITY DURING THE HOLOCENE, THE INTRODUCTION OF SALMONIDS AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF DAMS ARE LIKELY TO LEAD TO A DECLINE IN GENETIC DIVERSITY FOR AT LEAST SOME SPECIES. AN IMPROVEMENT IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESSES THAT INFLUENCED HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY DIVERSITY PATTERNS AMONG GALAXIID AND OTHER NATIVE FISHES IN SOUTH AMERICA IS NECESSARY FOR ADDRESSING THE CUMULATIVE AND SYNERGISTIC IMPACTS OF HUMAN ACTIVITY ON THIS UNIQUE FRESHWATER FAUNA.","ALO D, 2019, PEERJ, V7, DOI 10.7717/PEERJ.6149; ALO D, 2013, PLOS ONE, V8, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0071577; ANDERSON EP, 2018, SCI ADV, V4, DOI 10.1126/SCIADV.AAO1642; BECKER LA, 2018, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V816, P21, DOI 10.1007/S10750-017-3310-4; BELK MC, 2014, ECOL FRESHW FISH, V23, P615, DOI 10.1111/EFF.12114; BERRA TM, 1996, MAR FRESHWATER RES, V47, P845, DOI 10.1071/MF9960845; BERRA TM, 1994, T AM FISH SOC, V123, P595, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(1994)123<0595:ROGGEF>2.3.CO;2; BOY CC, 2007, J APPL ICHTHYOL, V23, P547, DOI 10.1111/J.1439-0426.2007.00842.X; BOY CC, 2009, J APPL ICHTHYOL, V25, P661, DOI 10.1111/J.1439-0426.2009.01309.X; BOY CC, 2009, POLAR BIOL, V32, P9, DOI 10.1007/S00300-008-0495-Z; BURRIDGE CP, 2012, J BIOGEOGR, V39, P306, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2699.2011.02600.X; CAMPOS H, 1974, STUDIES ON THE NEOTROPICAL FAUNA, V9, P55, DOI 10.1080/01650527409360470; CARREA C, 2013, FRESHWATER BIOL, V58, P36, DOI 10.1111/FWB.12036; CARREA C, 2012, BIOL J LINN SOC, V107, P368, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8312.2012.01939.X; CORREA C, 2012, FRESHWATER BIOL, V57, P1769, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2427.2012.02837.X; CORREA-ARANEDA F, 2014, REV CHIL HIST NAT, V87, DOI 10.1186/S40693-014-0020-4, 10.1186/S40693-014-0020-4; CUSSAC V, 2004, J BIOGEOGR, V31, P103, DOI 10.1046/J.0305-0270.2003.01000.X; CUSSAC VE, 2016, J FISH BIOL, V89, P1068, DOI 10.1111/JFB.13008; CUSSAC VE, 1992, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V35, P141, DOI 10.1007/BF00002189; DELGADO ML, 2019, MOL ECOL, V28, P5217, DOI 10.1111/MEC.15290; DIAZ G, 2019, REV CHIL HIST NAT, V92, DOI 10.1186/S40693-019-0081-5; DUNN NR, 2020, DIVERSITY-BASEL, V12, DOI 10.3390/D12050183; DYER BRIAN S., 2000, ESTUDIOS OCEANOLOGICOS, V19, P77; EBY LA, 2006, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V21, P576, DOI 10.1016/J.TREE.2006.06.016; ELGUETA A, 2013, J FISH BIOL, V82, P430, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8649.2012.03489.X; BARRANTES ME, 2017, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V802, P255, DOI 10.1007/S10750-017-3275-3; PONCE JF, 2011, BIOL J LINN SOC, V103, P363, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8312.2011.01653.X; FRASER CI, 2012, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V27, P462, DOI 10.1016/J.TREE.2012.04.011; GONZALEZ-WEVAR C, 2015, J HERED, V106, P439, DOI 10.1093/JHERED/ESV005; GONZALEZ-WEVAR CA, 2015, PLOS ONE, V10, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0131289; HABIT E., 2015, ECOSISTEMAS, V24, P43, DOI 10.7818/ECOS.2015.24-1.08; HABIT E, 2019, RIVER RES APPL, V35, P489, DOI 10.1002/RRA.3374; HABIT E, 2012, GAYANA, V76, P10, DOI 10.4067/S0717-65382012000100002; HABIT E, 2012, DIVERS DISTRIB, V18, P1153, DOI 10.1111/J.1472-4642.2012.00906.X; HABIT E, 2010, GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR, V19, P697, DOI 10.1111/J.1466-8238.2010.00541.X; CAVALLOTTO JL, 2011, BIOL J LINN SOC, V103, P346, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8312.2011.01683.X; MACCHI PJ, 1999, ECOL FRESHW FISH, V8, P227, DOI 10.1111/J.1600-0633.1999.TB00074.X; MALDONADO-MARQUEZ A, 2020, J FISH BIOL, V96, P1495, DOI 10.1111/JFB.14309; MCDOWALL RM, 2006, FISH FISH, V7, P153, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-2979.2006.00217.X; MCDOWALL R M, 1975, NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH, V9, P1; MCDOWALL R.M., 1968, NZ MARINE DEP FISHER, V2, P1; MCDOWALL RM, 1971, J ROY SOC NEW ZEAL, V1, P31, DOI 10.1080/03036758.1971.10419354; MCDOWALL RM, 1988, COPEIA, P233, DOI 10.2307/1445940; MERCER M, 2020, DIVERSITY-BASEL, V12, DOI 10.3390/D12060219; MILANO D, 2006, BIOL J LINN SOC, V87, P69, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8312.2006.00556.X; MILANO D, 2002, J FISH BIOL, V61, P138, DOI 10.1006/JFBI.2002.2027; MILANO D, 2018, MAR FRESHWATER RES, V69, P1379, DOI 10.1071/MF17304; MONTOYA G, 2012, GAYANA, V76, P86, DOI 10.4067/S0717-65382012000100008; MURILLO H.

WE ANALYSED MITOCHONDRIAL DNA (MTDNA) SEQUENCES FROM 225 INDIVIDUALS OF GALAXIAS MACULATUS AND 136 OF G.

DEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSES SHOWED G. MACULATUS KEPT A HIGHER POPULATION SIZE OVER TIME, WITH A SIGNAL OF DEMOGRAPHIC EXPANSION IN THE LAST 250 KYR. WHEREAS GALAXIAS PLATEI, EXHIBITED LOWER, BUT CONSTANT POPULATION SIZE OVER TIME. FURTHERMORE, HAPLOTYPE NETWORKS REVEALED HIGHER LINEAGE DIVERSITY IN G. MACULATUS WITH A TENDENCY TO OCCUPY DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE BASIN. COALESCENT SIMULATIONS RULED OUT THAT GENETIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SPECIES COULD BE EXPLAINED BY STOCHASTIC PROCESSES (GENETIC DRIFT), SUGGESTING SPECIES-SPECIFIC BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES AS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OBSERVED GENETIC DIFFERENCES.

WE USE GEOMETRIC MORPHOMETRICS TO CHARACTERIZE SHAPE DIFFERENCES INGALAXIAS MACULATUS(JENYNS) BETWEEN RIVER AND LAKE POPULATIONS. LAKE FISH CONVERGE ON A SHAPE WITH A MORE FUSIFORM BODY, NARROWER HEAD, AND LARGER EYES, WHILE RIVER FISH HAVE A MORE ROBUST BODY, ROUNDER HEAD, AND SMALLER EYES. THESE SHAPE CHANGES ARE CONSISTENT WITH A SHIFT TO ZOOPLANKTIVOROUS FORAGING IN LAKES, AS EVIDENCED IN OTHER SYSTEMS. UNLIKE SOME FISH SPECIES THAT DEVELOP POLYMORPHISMS IN BODY SHAPE AFTER COLONIZATION (E.G., BENTHIC AND LIMNETIC FORMS),G. MACULATUSIN LAKES EXHIBIT A MONOMORPHIC LIMNETIC FORM.","ALI MY, 1974, CAN J ZOOL, V52, P959, DOI 10.1139/Z74-128; ANDERSON T., 2003, INTRO MULTIVARIATE S; BARRIGA JP, 2002, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V36, P345, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2002.9517092;

THEREFORE, AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS THAT DIFFER IN COLOR CAN POTENTIALLY CONTRIBUTE TO SPECIES POLYMORPHISM, ESPECIALLY IN FISH. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LIGHT QUALITY AND INTENSITY IN WATER BODIES AND THE EYE AND MOUTH SIZE IN GALAXIAS MACULATUS, ONE OF THE MOST WIDESPREAD FISH. FISH MORPHOLOGY WAS STUDIED PHOTOGRAPHICALLY, AND THE VERTICAL ATTENUATION COEFFICIENT OF LIGHT (K-D) WAS MEASURED IN FIVE AQUATIC SYSTEMS: TWO HUMIC LAKES, TWO ESTUARIES, AND ONE RIVER. WATER COLOR WAS ALSO ESTIMATED AS ABSORBANCE AT 440 NM. IN THOSE ENVIRONMENTS WITH LESS LIGHT PENETRATION AND DARKER WATER COLOR, WE OBSERVED BIGGER EYES AND, ADDITIONALLY, LARGER MOUTHS. THE DARKNESS OF WATER BODIES WAS MAINLY RELATED TO WATER COLOR ASSOCIATED WITH HUMIC SUBSTANCES. AS G. MACULATUS IS KNOWN TO BE A VISUAL PREDATOR, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT BIGGER EYES INCREASE VISUAL CAPACITY IN DARKER ENVIRONMENTS, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN IMPROVED FEEDING RATES, ALSO SUPPORTED BY LARGER MOUTH LENGTH.","AKSNES DL, 1993, ECOL MODEL, V67, P233, DOI 10.1016/0304-3800(93)90007-F; ALBERTO FERRIZ RICARDO, 2015, BIOIKOS (CAMPINAS), V29, P19; ALI MA, 1990, AUST J ZOOL, V38, P173, DOI 10.1071/ZO9900173; ANTHONY PD, 1981, J FISH BIOL, V19, P87, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8649.1981.TB05814.X; APHA AWWA WEF, 2005, STANDARD METHODS EXA, V21; BARBEE NC, 2011, MAR FRESHWATER RES, V62, P790, DOI 10.1071/MF10284; BARTELS P, 2016, ECOSYSTEMS, V19, P955, DOI 10.1007/S10021-016-9978-X; BOY CC, 2009, J APPL ICHTHYOL, V25, P661, DOI 10.1111/J.1439-0426.2009.01309.X; BRECK JE, 1993, T AM FISH SOC, V122, P902, DOI 10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0902:FTAPFA>2.3.CO;2; BRISTOW BT, 1996, PROG FISH CULT, V58, P1, DOI 10.1577/1548-8640(1996)058<0001:CPOICL>2.3.CO;2; CARTER MW, 2010, T AM FISH SOC, V139, P353, DOI 10.1577/T08-159.1; CHAPMAN A, 2006, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V77, P21, DOI 10.1007/S10641-006-9051-2; CURTIS PJ, 1995, BIOGEOCHEMISTRY, V30, P59, DOI 10.1007/BF02181040; CUSSAC VE, 1992, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V35, P141, DOI 10.1007/BF00002189; DOUGLAS RH, 1998, VISION RES, V38, P2697, DOI 10.1016/S0042-6989(98)00021-2; DUGAS MB, 2012, CAN J ZOOL, V90, P1431, DOI 10.1139/CJZ-2012-0192; HECHT T, 1992, S AFR J ZOOL, V27, P95; HELFMAN G.S., 2009, DIVERSITY FISHES; HEUBEL KU, 2006, J FISH BIOL, V68, P555, DOI 10.1111/J.0022-1112.2006.00941.X; JENYNS L., 1842, ZOOLOGY VOYAGE HMS B; JONES RI, 1992, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V229, P73, DOI 10.1007/BF00006992; KARPOUZI VS, 2003, J FISH BIOL, V62, P1353, DOI 10.1046/J.1095-8649.2003.00118.X; KEAST A, 1966, J FISH RES BOARD CAN, V23, P1845, DOI 10.1139/F66-175; KIRK JTO, 2011, LIGHT PHOTOSYNTHESIS; KOENINGS JP, 1991, LIMNOL OCEANOGR, V36, P91, DOI 10.4319/LO.1991.36.1.0091; LATTUCA ME, 2007, J APPL ICHTHYOL, V23, P25, DOI 10.1111/J.1439-0426.2006.00789.X; LI KT, 1985, ECOLOGY, V66, P1729, DOI 10.2307/2937368; LJUNGGREN L, 2007, J FISH BIOL, V70, P1319, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8649.2007.01412.X; MAAN ME, 2010, BIOL J LINN SOC, V99, P398, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8312.2009.01368.X; MAGNHAGEN C, 2001, FUNCT ECOL, V15, P754, DOI 10.1046/J.0269-8463.2001.00576.X; MCDOWALL R.M., 1968, GALAXIAS MACULATUS J; MCDOWALL RM, 2003, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V66, P361, DOI 10.1023/A:1023902922843; MCDOWALL RM, 1990, NZ FRESHWATER FISHES; MCPHAIL JD, 1984, CAN J ZOOL, V62, P1402, DOI 10.1139/Z84-201; MILANO D, 2010, AQUAT ECOL, V44, P741, DOI 10.1007/S10452-010-9312-1; MORAN D, 2015, SCI ADV, V1, DOI 10.1126/SCIADV.1500363; NIVEN JE, 2008, J EXP BIOL, V211, P1792, DOI 10.1242/JEB.017574; NORTON SF, 1991, ECOLOGY, V72, P1807, DOI 10.2307/1940980; BARRIGA JP, 2012, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V679, P27, DOI 10.1007/S10750-011-0849-3; PYKE GH, 1984, ANNU REV ECOL SYST, V15, P523, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV.ES.15.110184.002515; R CORE TEAM, 2018, R LANG ENV STAT COMP; ROHLF JF, 2015, TPSDIG2 DIGITIZE LAN; ROJO JH, 2018, ENVIRON BIOL FISH, V101, P1149, DOI 10.1007/S10641-018-0765-8; ROWE DK, 1998, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V32, P21, DOI 10.1080/00288330.1998.9516803; SAAD JF, 2016, J PLANKTON RES, V38, P818, DOI 10.1093/PLANKT/FBW029; SUHETT AL, 2007, CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI, V64, P1266, DOI 10.1139/F07-103; TYTLER P, 1985, FISH ENERGETICS NEW; UTNE ACW, 1997, J FISH BIOL, V50, P926, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8649.1997.TB01619.X; VINYARD GL, 1976, J FISH RES BOARD CAN, V33, P2845, DOI 10.1139/F76-342",10.1007/S10750-020-04278-Y,0,ARGENTINA;ARGENTINA;ARGENTINA,13,GOVT,CENTRO AUSTRAL DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTFICAS,ARGENTINA,PATAGONIA,N,Y,N,N,N,N,REGIONAL,1.5,N,0.083333333,NA,Y,N,N,N,N,N,NA,NA,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,Y

MORPHOLOGICAL VARIATION BETWEEN HABITAT TYPES WAS INVESTIGATED BY COMPARISON OF POPULATIONS OF GALAXIAS BREVIPINNIS (INFERRED ANCESTOR), GALAXIAS GOLLUMOIDES (ROUNDHEAD MORPHOTYPE) AND GALAXIAS VULGARIS (FLATHEAD MORPHOTYPE). INTERSPECIFIC CONVERGENCE AND INTRASPECIFIC DIVERGENCE OF MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS WERE DEMONSTRATED, REPRESENTING GENERAL SHIFTS IN MORPHOLOGY TOWARDS A COMMON FUNCTIONAL FORM IN PARTICULAR HYDROLOGICAL ENVIRONMENTS. IN ALL SPECIES, MORE LENTIC GALAXIAS HAD LONGER BODIES; SHORTER, MORE STOUT CAUDAL PEDUNCLES; LONGER, NARROWER PECTORAL FINS; AND LONGER, WIDER HEADS WITH LARGER MOUTHS. IN COMPARISON, LOTIC GALAXIAS HAD RELATIVELY SHORTER BODIES; MORE SLENDER CAUDAL PEDUNCLES; BROADER PECTORAL FINS; AND SHORTER FLATTER HEADS, WITH SMALLER MOUTHS. THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE HYDROLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT OF A HABITAT IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR MOULDING AND MAINTAINING AN INDIVIDUAL FISH'S MORPHOLOGY TO A PARTICULAR HABITAT TYPE, MOST LIKELY REPRESENTING A PHENOTYPIC PLASTIC RESPONSE.","ALEXANDER R.M., 1967, FUNCTIONAL DESIGN FI, P160; ALLIBONE RM, 1993, BIOL J LINN SOC, V50, P19, DOI 10.1006/BIJL.1993.1045; BERRA TM, 1973, COPEIA, P363; BLAXTER JHS, 1988, FISH PHYSIOL, V11, P1; BRINSMEAD J, 2002, J FISH BIOL, V61, P1619, DOI 10.1006/JFBI.2002.2179; BURRIDGE CP, 2006, EVOLUTION, V60, P1038; BURRIDGE CP, 2007, MOL ECOL, V16, P1883, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-294X.2006.03196.X; CADWALLADER PL, 1976, AUST J MAR FRESH RES, V27, P23; CHAPMAN A., 1976, INTRO FRESHWATER CRU, P261; CLARKE K.R, 2001, CHANGE MARINE COMMUN; CLARKE KR., 2006, PRIMER V6 USER MANUA, P190; CROW SK, 2011, NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH, V45, P689, DOI 10.1080/00288330.2011.579619; CROW SK, 2009, J ROY SOC NEW ZEAL, V39, P43, DOI 10.1080/03014220909510563; DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION, 2004, THREAT SPEC REC PLAN, P45; DEWITT T.

IN THIS STUDY, WE EXPANDED AN HISTORICAL (1964) SAMPLING PROGRAMME TO GAIN A CONTEMPORARY UNDERSTANDING OF THE SPECIES COMPOSITION OF THE WHITEBAIT FISHERY; 87 RIVERS WERE SAMPLED OVER SIX MONTHS IN 2015. OVER THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, >12 SPECIES WERE FOUND IN SAMPLES AND 84.6\% OF THESE WERE INANGA (GALAXIAS MACULATUS). KOARO (G. BREVIPINNIS) AND BANDED KOKOPU (G. FASCIATUS) WERE ABUNDANT IN SOME RIVERS AND REGIONS AT PARTICULAR TIMES OF THE YEAR. BULLER WAS THE MOST VARIABLE REGION, SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY, FOR SPECIES COMPOSITION; CANTERBURY WAS THE LEAST VARIABLE. BANDED KOKOPU WHITEBAIT MIGRATED ONE MONTH EARLIER NORTH OF COOK STRAIT THAN IN THE SOUTH. THERE WAS A POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE ABUNDANCE OF KOARO AND BANDED KOKOPU IN SAMPLES AND THE LEVEL OF INDIGENOUS FOREST COVER IN CATCHMENTS. COMPARED TO SAMPLES FROM 50 YEARS AGO, THERE WAS A GREATER PROPORTION OF KOARO AND BANDED KOKOPU WHITEBAIT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THIS SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY REQUIRES FISHERY REGULATIONS TO BE MORE TAILORED AND FLEXIBLE IF THEY ARE TO CONSERVE THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE-HISTORIES PRESENT IN THE CATCH AND SUSTAIN THE WHITEBAIT FISHERY.","ALLIBONE R, 1999, WATER ATMOSPHERE, V7, P11; ANDERSON M, 2008, PERMANOVA PRIMER GUI; AUGSPURGER J.

IN TASMANIA, WHERE THE NATIVE FISH ARE MOSTLY GALAXIIDS, 9 NON-NATIVE FRESHWATER FISH SPECIES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED OVER THE PAST 150 YEARS, WITH UNCERTAIN ECOLOGICAL OUTCOMES. WE EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF NON-NATIVE PREDATORY FISHES (NNPF) AND VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL AND BIOLOGICAL VARIABLES ON THE TROPHIC NICHE OF NATIVE FISH (GALAXIIDS) AND POTENTIAL CASCADING EFFECTS. WE ANALYSED LAYMANS FOOD WEB METRICS BASED ON BOTH STABLE ISOTOPE ( 15N AND 13C) VALUES AND FISH STOMACH CONTENTS IN 14 SHALLOW TASMANIAN LAKES ALONG A NNPF ABUNDANCE GRADIENT. THE FOOD WEB METRICS CALCULATED WERE (1) RANGE OF 13C (CR) AND 15N (NR) CENTROID DISTANCE (CD) AND (2) STANDARD ELLIPSE AREA. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT NNPF RELATIVE ABUNDANCE IN THE FISH CATCH PER UNIT EFFORT WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO THE GALAXIIDS TROPHIC NICHE METRICS (E.G., CRG, NRG, AND CDG), TROPHIC POSITION, AND THE PELAGIC CONTRIBUTION TO THE DIET. MOREOVER, THE PROPORTION OF GALAXIIDS IN THE DIET OF NNPF WAS HIGHER IN TURBID LAKES. THE ZOOPLANKTON STANDARD ELLIPSE AREA WAS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE PELAGIC CONTRIBUTION TO THE NNPF DIET, AND NNPF RELATIVE ABUNDANCE WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE MAXIMUM BODY SIZE OF CALANOID COPEPODS. WHILE OUR RESULTS SUGGEST A NEGATIVE EFFECT OF NNPF ON THE TROPHIC NICHE OF GALAXIIDS, THE CASCADING EFFECT ON PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS WAS WEAK. NON-NATIVE PREDATORY FISH AFFECT NATIVE FISH PREY, AND THE OUTCOME OF THESE INTERACTIONS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES, PARTICULARLY FOR ISLAND LAKES, SUCH AS THOSE IN TASMANIA. 2020 INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF LIMNOLOGY (SIL).","ABRAHAMS, M., KATTENFELD, M., THE ROLE OF TURBIDITY AS A CONSTRAINT ON PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS IN AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS (1997) BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL, 40, PP. 169-174; ALA, A., ALTNDA, A., YLMAZ, M., KRPK, M.A., AK, A., FEEDING HABITS OF TENCH (TINCA TINCA L., 1758) IN BEYEHIR LAKE (TURKEY) (2010) TURK J FISH AQUAT SCI, 10, PP. 187-194; AMSINCK, L., STRZELCZAK, A., BJERRING, R., LANDKILDEHUS, F., LAURIDSEN, T.L., CHRISTOFFERSEN, K., JEPPESEN, E., LAKE DEPTH RATHER THAN FISH PLANKTIVORY DETERMINES CLADOCERAN COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN FAROESE LAKES?

SPAWNING GROUND PROTECTION AND REHABILITATION IS REQUIRED TO REVERSE HISTORICAL DEGRADATION AND IMPROVE FISHERIES PROSPECTS ALONGSIDE CONSERVATION GOALS. ALTHOUGH SPAWNING HABITAT HAS BEEN CHARACTERISED IN TIDAL RIVERS, THERE HAS BEEN NO PREVIOUS STUDY OF SPAWNING IN NON-TIDAL RIVERMOUTHS THAT ARE OPEN TO THE SEA. WE ASSESSED SEVEN NON-TIDAL RIVERS OVER 4 MONTHS USING CENSUS SURVEYS TO QUANTIFY SPAWNING ACTIVITY, IDENTIFY ENVIRONMENTAL CUES, AND CHARACTERISE FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF THE BIOGEOGRAPHY OF SPAWNING GROUNDS. RESULTS INCLUDE THE IDENTIFICATION OF COMPACT SPAWNING REACHES NEAR THE RIVERMOUTHS. SPAWNING EVENTS WERE TRIGGERED BY PERIODS OF ELEVATED WATER LEVELS THAT WERE OFTEN OF VERY SHORT DURATION, SUGGESTING THAT POTENTIAL LUNAR CUES WERE LESS IMPORTANT, AND THAT RAPID FISH MOVEMENTS HAD LIKELY OCCURRED WITHIN THE CATCHMENT PRIOR TO SPAWNING EVENTS. SPAWNING GROUNDS EXHIBITED CONSISTENT VERTICAL STRUCTURING ABOVE TYPICAL LOW-FLOW LEVELS, WITH ASSOCIATED HORIZONTAL TRANSLATION AWAY FROM THE RIVER CHANNEL LEADING TO INCREASED EXPOSURE TO ANTHROPOGENIC STRESSORS AND ASSOCIATED MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS FOR PROTECTING THE AREAS CONCERNED. THESE CONSISTENT PATTERNS PROVIDE A SOUND BASIS FOR ADVANCING PROTECTIVE MANAGEMENT AT NON-TIDAL RIVERMOUTHS. ATTENTION TO FLOOD MANAGEMENT, VEGETATION CONTROL, AND BANKSIDE RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES IS NEEDED AND MAY BE ASSISTED BY ELUCIDATING THE BIOGEOGRAPHY OF SPAWNING GROUNDS. THE IDENTIFICATION OF RAPID RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENTAL CUES DESERVES FURTHER RESEARCH TO ASSESS FLOODPLAIN CONNECTIVITY ASPECTS THAT ENABLE FISH MOVEMENTS IN EPHEMERAL FLOWPATHS, AND AS A CONFOUNDING FACTOR IN COMMONLY USED FISH SURVEY TECHNIQUES.",NA,10.1101/2020.11.06.372243,2,NEW ZEALAND;NEW ZEALAND,358,TERTIARY,UOC,NZ,CANTERBURY,N,Y,N,N,N,N,REGIONAL,45,Y,0.333333332,4,Y,N,N,N,N,N,NA,NA,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N
